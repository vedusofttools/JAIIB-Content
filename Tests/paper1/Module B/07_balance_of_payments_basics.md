# Balance of Payments (BoP)

------------------------------------------------------------
## 1. Meaning of Balance of Payments

Balance of Payments (BoP) is a systematic record of all economic transactions between the residents of a country and the rest of the world during a specific period (usually one year).

It follows the double-entry accounting system. Hence, BoP always balances in accounting sense.

------------------------------------------------------------
## 2. Structure of Balance of Payments

BoP has two main accounts:

1. Current Account
2. Capital/Financial Account

In addition, there is:
- Errors & Omissions
- Change in Foreign Exchange Reserves

------------------------------------------------------------
## 3. Current Account

The Current Account records transactions related to goods, services, income, and transfers.

### (A) Trade in Goods (Merchandise Trade)
Exports of goods – Imports of goods = Trade Balance

If exports > imports → Trade Surplus  
If imports > exports → Trade Deficit

### (B) Trade in Services
Includes:
- IT services
- Banking services
- Insurance
- Tourism
- Transportation

India often has surplus in services (especially IT).

### (C) Primary Income
Includes:
- Interest payments
- Dividends
- Profit repatriation
- Compensation of employees

### (D) Secondary Income (Transfers)
Includes:
- Remittances from abroad
- Gifts and grants
- Aid

Remittances are important for India’s current account.

------------------------------------------------------------
## 4. Capital / Financial Account

Records financial transactions involving assets and liabilities.

Includes:

### (A) Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)
Long-term investment in business and production.
Stable and preferred source of capital.

### (B) Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI)
Investment in shares and bonds.
Short-term and volatile.

### (C) External Commercial Borrowings (ECB)
Loans from foreign lenders.

### (D) Banking Capital
Includes NRI deposits and banking flows.

## 5. Accounting Identity

BoP Identity:

Current Account + Capital Account + Errors & Omissions = Change in Forex Reserves

If:
Current Account Deficit (CAD) > Capital Inflows  
→ Forex reserves decline.

If:
Capital Inflows > CAD  
→ Forex reserves increase.

------------------------------------------------------------
## 6. Current Account Deficit (CAD)

CAD occurs when imports of goods and services exceed exports.

CAD = Trade Deficit + Net Income Outflows – Net Transfers

Causes of CAD:
- High oil imports
- Gold imports
- Weak exports
- High domestic demand

Sustainable CAD is usually considered around 2–3% of GDP.

------------------------------------------------------------
## 7. Current Account Surplus

Occurs when exports exceed imports.

Effects:
- Forex reserves increase
- Currency may appreciate
- Strong external position

------------------------------------------------------------
## 8. Capital Account Surplus

Occurs when capital inflows exceed capital outflows.

Sources:
- FDI
- FPI
- External borrowing

Risk:
Excess dependence on volatile capital (FPI) increases vulnerability.

------------------------------------------------------------
## 9. Exchange Rate and BoP

If CAD increases:
→ Demand for foreign currency rises
→ Domestic currency depreciates

If BoP surplus:
→ Currency appreciates

------------------------------------------------------------
## 10. Marshall–Lerner Condition

Currency depreciation improves trade balance only if:

Elasticity of exports + Elasticity of imports > 1

If elasticities are low, depreciation may worsen trade balance initially.

------------------------------------------------------------
## 11. J-Curve Effect

After depreciation:
- Import bill rises initially (contracts fixed)
- Trade deficit worsens first
- Improves later as quantities adjust

Graphically resembles the letter “J”.

------------------------------------------------------------
## 12. Twin Deficit Hypothesis

Fiscal Deficit ↑  
→ Government borrowing ↑  
→ Domestic savings ↓  
→ Imports ↑  
→ CAD ↑

Hence fiscal deficit and CAD may move together.

------------------------------------------------------------
## 13. Forex Reserves

Forex reserves include:
- Foreign currency assets
- Gold
- SDRs
- Reserve position in IMF

Uses:
- Financing BoP deficit
- Stabilizing exchange rate
- External stability

------------------------------------------------------------
## 14. Causes of BoP Disequilibrium

Short-term causes:
- Oil price shock
- Global recession
- Capital flight

Long-term causes:
- Structural export weakness
- Low productivity
- High import dependence

------------------------------------------------------------
## 15. Measures to Correct BoP Deficit

1. Monetary measures
    - Raise interest rates
    - Tight monetary policy

2. Fiscal measures
    - Reduce fiscal deficit
    - Reduce import demand

3. Exchange rate adjustment
    - Depreciation

4. Structural reforms
    - Export promotion
    - Import substitution
    - Improve competitiveness

------------------------------------------------------------
## 16. Importance of BoP

- Indicator of external sector health
- Affects exchange rate
- Influences monetary policy
- Determines credit rating
- Impacts investor confidence

------------------------------------------------------------
## 17. Key Ratios for Exam

1. CAD as % of GDP
2. External Debt to GDP
3. Import cover (Forex reserves / Monthly imports)
4. Short-term debt to reserves ratio

------------------------------------------------------------
## 18. Summary Flow

If:
Imports ↑ sharply  
→ Trade deficit ↑  
→ CAD ↑  
→ Currency depreciates  
→ Inflation may rise  
→ RBI may intervene

If:
FDI ↑  
→ Capital account surplus  
→ Forex reserves ↑  
→ Currency pressure reduces
