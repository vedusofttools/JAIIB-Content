# Supply, Demand and Elasticity

## Introduction
Supply and demand are the **core forces of price determination** in a market economy.  
They explain how prices and quantities of goods and services are decided through the interaction of buyers and sellers.

Elasticity explains **how sensitive demand or supply is to changes** in price, income, or related factors.

These concepts are frequently tested in JAIIB through:
- Conceptual MCQs
- Numerical problems
- Applied banking situations (interest rates, credit demand, inflation)

## Demand

## Meaning of Demand
Demand refers to the **quantity of a good or service that consumers are willing and able to purchase at a given price during a given period of time**.

Key points embedded in demand:
- Willingness to buy
- Ability to pay
- Price
- Time period

Mere desire without purchasing power is **not demand**.

## Law of Demand
The law of demand states that:
> **Other things remaining constant, quantity demanded of a good increases when its price falls and decreases when its price rises.**

This establishes an **inverse relationship** between price and quantity demanded.

---

## Reasons Behind Law of Demand
- Law of diminishing marginal utility
- Income effect
- Substitution effect
- Entry of new consumers at lower prices

---

## Demand Curve
A demand curve slopes **downward from left to right**, showing:
- Higher demand at lower prices
- Lower demand at higher prices

Movement occurs **along the demand curve** when price changes.

---

## Change in Demand vs Change in Quantity Demanded

### Change in Quantity Demanded
- Caused only by price change
- Movement along the same demand curve

### Change in Demand
- Caused by factors other than price
- Entire demand curve shifts

---

## Factors Causing Change in Demand
- Income of consumers
- Prices of related goods
- Tastes and preferences
- Population
- Expectations about future prices

---

## Supply

## Meaning of Supply
Supply refers to the **quantity of a good or service that producers are willing and able to offer for sale at a given price during a given period of time**.

---

## Law of Supply
The law of supply states that:
> **Other things remaining constant, quantity supplied increases when price rises and decreases when price falls.**

This establishes a **direct relationship** between price and quantity supplied.

---

## Reasons Behind Law of Supply
- Profit motive
- Higher returns at higher prices
- Ability to expand production

---

## Supply Curve
A supply curve slopes **upward from left to right**, showing:
- More supply at higher prices
- Less supply at lower prices

---

## Change in Supply vs Change in Quantity Supplied

### Change in Quantity Supplied
- Caused by price change
- Movement along supply curve

### Change in Supply
- Caused by non-price factors
- Shift of entire supply curve

---

## Factors Causing Change in Supply
- Cost of production
- Technology
- Taxes and subsidies
- Prices of related goods
- Government policy
- Expectations

---

## Elasticity

## Meaning of Elasticity
Elasticity measures the **degree of responsiveness** of demand or supply to changes in:
- Price
- Income
- Prices of related goods

Elasticity answers the question:
> “By how much does quantity change when something else changes?”

---

## Price Elasticity of Demand (PED)

## Meaning
Price elasticity of demand measures the **responsiveness of quantity demanded to change in price**.

---

## Formula
Price Elasticity of Demand (Ed) =  
Percentage change in quantity demanded ÷ Percentage change in price

---

## Types of Price Elasticity of Demand

### Perfectly Elastic Demand
- Small change in price leads to infinite change in demand
- Demand curve is horizontal

### Perfectly Inelastic Demand
- Quantity demanded does not change despite price change
- Demand curve is vertical

### Relatively Elastic Demand
- Percentage change in quantity demanded is greater than price change

### Relatively Inelastic Demand
- Percentage change in quantity demanded is smaller than price change

### Unitary Elastic Demand
- Percentage change in quantity demanded equals price change

## Income Elasticity of Demand

## Meaning
Income elasticity of demand measures the **responsiveness of demand to change in income**.

---

## Interpretation
- Positive income elasticity → normal goods
- Negative income elasticity → inferior goods
- Zero income elasticity → necessities

---

## Cross Elasticity of Demand

## Meaning
Cross elasticity of demand measures the **change in demand for one good due to change in price of another good**.

---

## Interpretation
- Positive → substitute goods
- Negative → complementary goods
- Zero → unrelated goods

---

## Elasticity of Supply

## Meaning
Elasticity of supply measures the **responsiveness of quantity supplied to price changes**.

---

## Factors Affecting Elasticity of Supply
- Time period
- Nature of commodity
- Storage capacity
- Production flexibility

---

## Practical Importance in Banking and Economy
- Helps banks assess credit demand sensitivity
- Explains impact of interest rate changes
- Useful in inflation analysis
- Important for government taxation policy
- Assists in pricing of financial products

## Common Exam Traps
- Confusing change in demand with change in quantity demanded
- Assuming demand always falls when income rises
- Forgetting time period in elasticity
- Treating supply elasticity same as demand elasticity
