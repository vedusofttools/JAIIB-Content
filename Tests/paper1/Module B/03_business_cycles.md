# Business Cycles

## Introduction
Business cycles refer to the **recurring fluctuations in overall economic activity** over time.  
They show how an economy moves through periods of **growth and decline**, affecting output, income, employment, prices, and credit.

Business cycles are not regular or predictable in timing, but they are a **common feature of market economies**.

## Meaning of Business Cycle
A business cycle is a **wave-like movement in economic activity** around the long-term growth trend.

It reflects:
- Expansion and contraction in output
- Rise and fall in employment
- Changes in investment and credit
- Variations in income and profits

## Phases of Business Cycle

## Expansion
Expansion is the phase where:
- Output increases
- Employment rises
- Income and profits grow
- Investment and credit expand
- Consumer confidence improves

This phase is associated with **economic growth** and optimism.

---

## Peak
Peak represents the **upper turning point** of the cycle.

At this stage:
- Economy operates near full capacity
- Inflationary pressures build up
- Costs rise faster than output
- Growth rate starts slowing

Peak marks the **end of expansion**.

## Contraction
Contraction is the phase where:
- Output declines
- Employment falls
- Investment reduces
- Profits shrink
- Demand weakens

Credit conditions tighten and business confidence deteriorates.

## Trough
Trough represents the **lowest point of economic activity**.

At this stage:
- Output and employment are at minimum
- Investment is very low
- Prices may stabilise or fall

Trough marks the **end of contraction** and the beginning of recovery.

## Recovery
Recovery is the phase where:
- Output starts increasing again
- Employment improves gradually
- Investment revives
- Confidence returns

Recovery leads back into **expansion**, completing the cycle.

## Causes of Business Cycles

## Fluctuations in Aggregate Demand
- Changes in consumption
- Changes in investment
- Government spending variations
- Export and import shocks

A fall in demand can trigger contraction.

---

## Investment Cycles
Investment decisions are highly sensitive to:
- Interest rates
- Expectations
- Business confidence

Sharp fall in investment often leads to recession.

---

## Credit Conditions
- Easy credit can fuel expansion
- Tight credit can deepen contraction

Bank lending plays a critical role in amplifying cycles.

---

## Monetary Factors
- Changes in money supply
- Interest rate movements
- Central bank policy actions

Excess liquidity may lead to boom; contractionary policy may slow growth.

---

## External Shocks
- Global financial crises
- Oil price shocks
- Pandemics
- Geopolitical events

Such shocks can disturb domestic business cycles.

## Indicators of Business Cycles

Indicators that change **before** the economy changes:
- Stock market movements
- New investment orders
- Consumer confidence

---

## Coincident Indicators
Indicators that move **with** the economy:
- GDP
- Industrial production
- Employment levels

---

## Lagging Indicators
Indicators that change **after** the economy changes:
- Inflation
- Unemployment rate
- Interest rates

---

## Business Cycles and Inflation
- Expansion may lead to inflation due to excess demand
- Contraction may reduce inflationary pressure
- Severe contraction can lead to deflation

---

## Business Cycles and Unemployment
- Expansion reduces unemployment
- Contraction increases unemployment
- Recovery gradually absorbs labour

---

## Role of Government and Policy

## Monetary Policy Response
- Expansionary policy during contraction
- Contractionary policy during overheating
- Interest rate and liquidity adjustments

---

## Fiscal Policy Response
- Increased government spending during downturns
- Reduced spending during inflationary phases
- Counter-cyclical fiscal policy

---

## Business Cycles and Banking Sector
- Credit growth rises during expansion
- NPAs tend to increase during contraction
- Asset quality worsens in downturns
- Banks face liquidity and profitability pressure
- Risk management becomes crucial during cycles

## Can Business Cycles Be Eliminated?
- Business cycles cannot be completely eliminated
- Policy intervention can **reduce severity**
- Sound regulation can limit excessive booms and busts

---

## Relevance for Banking and Economy
- Helps banks plan credit strategy
- Important for risk assessment
- Explains cyclical nature of NPAs
- Useful in macroeconomic analysis

## Common Exam Traps
- Treating business cycles as regular and fixed
- Confusing peak with recovery
- Assuming cycles can be fully eliminated
- Ignoring role of credit and banking
