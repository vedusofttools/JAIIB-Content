## 1.
The IS curve represents equilibrium in:

A. Money market  
B. Goods market  
C. Labour market  
D. Foreign exchange market

Answer: B

Explanation:
IS curve shows combinations of income and interest rate where investment equals saving (goods market equilibrium).

------------------------------------------------------------

## 2.
The LM curve represents equilibrium in:

A. Goods market  
B. Capital market  
C. Money market  
D. Labour market

Answer: C

Explanation:
LM curve shows combinations of income and interest rate where money demand equals money supply.

------------------------------------------------------------

## 3.
The IS curve is downward sloping because:

A. Higher interest reduces investment  
B. Higher income reduces consumption  
C. Money supply falls  
D. Taxes increase

Answer: A

Explanation:
Higher interest rates reduce investment spending, lowering income.

## 4.
The LM curve is upward sloping because:

A. Higher income increases money demand  
B. Higher income reduces money supply  
C. Higher interest increases income  
D. Investment rises

Answer: A

Explanation:
Higher income increases transaction demand for money → higher interest rate needed.

## 9.
Liquidity trap implies:

A. LM is vertical  
B. LM is horizontal  
C. IS is vertical  
D. IS is horizontal

Answer: B

Explanation:

A. Steep  
B. Flat  
C. Vertical  
D. Horizontal

Higher investment increases aggregate demand.

------------------------------------------------------------

## 16.
Increase in money demand shifts:

A. LM left  
B. LM right  
C. IS right  
D. No shift

Answer: A

Explanation:
Higher money demand raises interest rate → LM shifts left.

------------------------------------------------------------

## 17.
Central bank conducts open market purchase. Effect?

A. IS right  
B. LM right  
C. LM left  
D. IS left

Answer: B

Explanation:
OMO purchase increases money supply → LM right.

------------------------------------------------------------

## 18.
Fall in consumer confidence shifts:

A. IS right  
B. IS left  
C. LM right  
D. LM left

Answer: B

Explanation:
Lower consumption reduces aggregate demand.

------------------------------------------------------------

## 19.
Increase in price level (fixed nominal money supply) shifts:

A. LM left  
B. LM right  
C. IS right  
D. No shift

Answer: A

Explanation:
Higher price level reduces real money supply → LM shifts left.

------------------------------------------------------------

## 20.
Simultaneous fiscal expansion and monetary expansion likely shift:

A. IS right & LM right  
B. IS left & LM left  
C. IS right & LM left

### PART C – ANALYTICAL APPLICATION (21–30)
############################

## 21.
MPC = 0.8. Government increases spending by 100. Income increases by:

A. 300  
B. 400  
C. 500  
D. 600

Answer: C

Explanation:
Multiplier = 1 / (1 – 0.8) = 5  
Income increase = 100 × 5 = 500

B. Only interest rate rise  
C. Income fall  
D. No change

Answer: B

If LM horizontal and fiscal expansion occurs, income:

A. Rises significantly  
B. No change  
C. Falls  
D. Zero

Answer: A

If IS is very steep and monetary expansion occurs, income:

A. Rises greatly  
B. Rises slightly  
C. Falls  
D. No change

Answer: B

Explanation:
