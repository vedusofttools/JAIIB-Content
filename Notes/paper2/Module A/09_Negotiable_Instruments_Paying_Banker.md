## 1. Introduction

The Paying Banker is the bank on which a cheque is drawn.  
When a customer issues a cheque, the banker is legally bound to honor it — subject to certain conditions.

The duties, rights, and liabilities of a paying banker are governed primarily by:

- Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881
- Banking Regulation Act
- Judicial precedents

Improper payment may result in:

- Financial loss to bank
- Legal liability
- Loss of statutory protection

This block focuses exclusively on legal framework relating to the paying banker.

## 2. Negotiable Instruments Act – Overview

The Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 governs:

- Promissory Notes
- Bills of Exchange
- Cheques

For banking operations, the most important instrument is the cheque.

A cheque is defined as:

A bill of exchange drawn on a specified banker and payable on demand.

## 3. Payment of a Cheque

The paying banker must honor a cheque if:

- It is properly drawn.
- It is presented within validity period.
- Sufficient funds are available.
- Signature matches specimen.
- No legal restriction exists.

If these conditions are satisfied, the bank must pay.

If bank wrongfully dishonors a cheque, it may be liable for damages.

## 4. Payment in Due Course – Section 10

Section 10 defines “Payment in Due Course”.

Payment in due course means:

Payment made in accordance with apparent tenor of instrument, in good faith and without negligence, to the person in possession thereof, under circumstances which do not afford reasonable ground for believing that he is not entitled to receive payment.

Key Elements:

- As per apparent tenor.
- In good faith.
- Without negligence.
- To rightful possessor.

If payment satisfies these conditions, bank gets statutory protection.

---

## 5. Liability of Paying Banker – Section 31

Section 31 states:

The drawee bank must pay cheque when duly required, provided sufficient funds are available.

If bank wrongfully dishonors cheque:

- It must compensate customer for loss or damage caused.

For business customers, wrongful dishonor may affect reputation and creditworthiness.

Example:

If a businessman’s cheque is dishonored despite sufficient balance, bank may be liable for damages.

---

## 6. Conditions for Proper Payment

A paying banker must ensure:

1. Proper form of cheque.
2. No material alteration.
3. Proper signature.
4. Sufficient funds.
5. Cheque not stale (validity period).
6. No stop payment instruction.
7. No garnishee order.

Failure to check any of these may result in liability.

---

## 7. Forged Signature

If customer’s signature is forged:

- Payment is not considered valid.
- Bank cannot debit customer’s account.
- Bank bears loss.

Reason:

There is no mandate from customer.

Forged signature nullifies the instrument.

Even if bank acted honestly, it cannot claim protection in case of forged drawer’s signature.

---

## 8. Material Alteration

Material alteration means alteration that changes legal character of instrument.

Examples:

- Change in amount.
- Change in date.
- Change in payee name.

If alteration is apparent and bank still pays, it loses protection.

If alteration is not apparent and bank pays in good faith, statutory protection may apply.

---

## 9. Payment Under Mistake

If bank pays under mistake:

- Recovery depends on circumstances.
- If mistake is due to bank’s negligence, recovery may be difficult.
- If payment made to wrong person without negligence, recovery may be possible.

Legal principles of restitution apply.

---

## 10. Payment to Holder vs True Owner

Bank must pay to “holder” of cheque.

Holder means person entitled in his own name to possession of instrument.

If payment made in due course to holder, bank is discharged even if holder is not true owner.

This provides statutory protection.

---

## 11. Post-Dated and Stale Cheques

Post-Dated Cheque:

Cheque bearing future date.

Bank must not honor it before date mentioned.

Stale Cheque:

Cheque presented after validity period (currently 3 months from date).

Bank must not honor stale cheque.

---

## 12. Stop Payment Instructions

Customer may instruct bank to stop payment.

Once valid stop instruction received:

- Bank must not pay cheque.
- If bank pays despite stop instruction, bank liable.

Stop instruction must be properly recorded and acknowledged.

---

## 13. Garnishee Order

If court issues garnishee order attaching account:

- Bank must freeze account.
- Bank must not honor cheques.

If bank pays cheque after receiving order, bank may be liable.

Only credit balance is attachable.

---

## 14. Death, Insolvency, or Lunacy of Customer

Upon notice of:

- Death
- Insolvency
- Mental incapacity

Bank must stop honoring cheques.

Payment after knowledge of death may result in liability.

---

## 15. Protection to Paying Banker

Protection available only if:

- Payment is in due course.
- No negligence.
- No apparent alteration.
- Proper verification done.

Protection not available in:

- Forged signature.
- Payment against stop instruction.
- Payment after garnishee order.

---

## 16. Case-Based Understanding

Case 1:

Signature slightly differs but reasonably matches specimen.  
If paid in good faith without negligence, bank protected.

Case 2:

Cheque amount altered visibly but bank ignores.  
Bank loses protection.

Case 3:

Cheque dishonored despite sufficient funds.  
Customer may claim damages.

Case 4:

Forged signature paid.  
Bank must bear loss.

## 17. Important JAIIB Legal Points

- Section 10 defines payment in due course.
- Section 31 imposes duty to honor cheque.
- Forged drawer signature makes cheque void.
- Material alteration invalidates cheque.
- Stop payment must be honored.
- Garnishee attaches only credit balance.
- Post-dated cheque cannot be paid before date.

---

## 18. Conceptual Clarity

The paying banker’s role involves balancing:

- Customer mandate
- Legal obligations
- Internal controls
- Risk management

Protection under law is conditional.

If bank acts:

- In good faith
- Without negligence
- As per apparent tenor

It is protected.

If negligence is proven, statutory protection fails.

Understanding these principles is essential for answering case-based JAIIB questions.
