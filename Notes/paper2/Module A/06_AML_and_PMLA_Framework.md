---

## 1. Introduction

Anti-Money Laundering (AML) is not merely a compliance guideline. It is a statutory obligation backed by criminal law in India.

The primary legislation governing AML in India is:

Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (PMLA)

Banks are legally classified as “Reporting Entities” under this Act and are bound to comply with its provisions.

Failure to comply can result in:

- Monetary penalties
- Criminal liability
- Regulatory sanctions by RBI
- Reputational damage

This block explains the legal framework in detail.

## 2. Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (PMLA)

### 2.1 Objective of PMLA

The Act was enacted to:

- Prevent money laundering.
- Confiscate property derived from crime.
- Punish those involved in laundering activities.

It criminalizes the process of laundering proceeds of crime.

---

## 3. Key Definitions under PMLA

### 3.1 Proceeds of Crime (Section 2(u))

Any property derived or obtained directly or indirectly as a result of criminal activity relating to a scheduled offence.

This includes:

- Money
- Immovable property

### 3.2 Scheduled Offence

PMLA contains a Schedule listing offences under various laws such as:

- Indian Penal Code
- Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act
- Prevention of Corruption Act
- Companies Act
- Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act

If money is generated from these offences, it becomes “proceeds of crime.”

---

### 3.3 Reporting Entity (Section 2(wa))

Includes:

- Banking companies
- Financial institutions
- Intermediaries

Banks are legally reporting entities and must comply with obligations under Chapter IV of PMLA.

---

## 4. Offence of Money Laundering – Section 3

Section 3 defines money laundering as:

Direct or indirect attempt to indulge or knowingly assist or be a party to or actually involved in any process connected with proceeds of crime, including concealment, possession, acquisition, use, projecting or claiming it as untainted property.

Important:

Even assisting in laundering process constitutes offence.

---

## 5. Punishment – Section 4

Punishment for money laundering:

- Rigorous imprisonment (minimum 3 years, may extend to 7 years).
- In certain offences (like NDPS), may extend to 10 years.
- Fine may also be imposed.

This shows seriousness of AML compliance.

---

## 6. Attachment and Confiscation of Property

Under PMLA:

- Enforcement Directorate (ED) can provisionally attach property suspected to be proceeds of crime.
- After adjudication, property may be confiscated.

Banks must cooperate with authorities in such proceedings.

---

## 7. Obligations of Reporting Entities – Chapter IV

Chapter IV of PMLA imposes obligations on banks.

These include:

### 7.1 Maintain Records of Transactions

Banks must maintain records of:

- All transactions.
- Cash transactions above prescribed limits.
- Suspicious transactions.

Records must be preserved for at least 5 years after transaction or account closure.

---

### 7.2 Furnish Information to FIU-IND

Banks must report:

- Cash Transaction Reports (CTR)
- Suspicious Transaction Reports (STR)
- Other prescribed reports

STR filing must be confidential.

Tipping off customer is prohibited.

---

### 7.3 Verify Identity of Clients (KYC)

Banks must:

- Identify customer.
- Verify identity using reliable documents.
- Identify beneficial owner.
- Understand nature of business relationship.

This is known as Customer Due Diligence (CDD).

---

## 8. Maintenance of Records Rules (PML Rules)

The Prevention of Money Laundering (Maintenance of Records) Rules, 2005 provide operational clarity.

These Rules specify:

- What transactions to record.
- Time period for retention.
- Reporting formats.
- Beneficial ownership identification.
- Enhanced due diligence for certain categories.

---

## 9. Financial Intelligence Unit – India (FIU-IND)

FIU-IND is the central agency responsible for:

- Receiving financial information.
- Analyzing suspicious transactions.
- Sharing intelligence with enforcement agencies.

Banks report directly to FIU-IND.

Principal Officer of bank is responsible for reporting compliance.

---

## 10. Terror Financing – Legal Position

Under Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA):

- Financing terrorist activities is a criminal offence.
- Banks must ensure no funds are transferred to individuals or entities listed in sanction lists.

Banks must screen customers against:

- UNSC Sanctions Lists.
- Government of India notified lists.

Freezing of accounts may be required immediately upon identification.

---

## 11. Risk-Based Approach – RBI Master Directions

RBI Master Directions on KYC require banks to adopt risk-based approach.

Customers must be categorized as:

- Low Risk
- Medium Risk
- High Risk

High-risk categories include:

- Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs)
- Non-face-to-face customers
- Complex corporate structures
- High-risk jurisdictions

Enhanced Due Diligence must be applied where risk is high.

---

## 12. Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD)

EDD involves:

- Obtaining additional information.
- Verifying source of funds.
- Periodic review of transactions.
- Senior management approval in high-risk cases.

Example:

A newly formed company receiving frequent foreign inward remittances must undergo enhanced scrutiny.

---

## 13. FATF and International Obligations

Financial Action Task Force (FATF) sets global AML standards.

India is a member.

Countries identified as:

- High-risk jurisdictions
- Jurisdictions under increased monitoring

require enhanced due diligence.

Banks must monitor transactions involving such jurisdictions carefully.

---

## 14. Correspondent Banking

Correspondent banking relationships involve cross-border services between banks.

Under AML framework:

- Enhanced due diligence required before establishing correspondent relationship.
- Must ensure foreign bank is not shell bank.
- Ongoing monitoring required.

Shell banks are prohibited.

---

## 15. Secrecy Obligations vs AML Reporting

Normally, banks must maintain confidentiality of customer information.

However:

PMLA overrides secrecy obligation for reporting purposes.

Bank must file STR without informing customer.

Informing customer about STR filing is called “tipping off” and is prohibited.

---

## 16. Consequences of Non-Compliance

Non-compliance may lead to:

- Penalties under PMLA.
- Action by Enforcement Directorate.
- RBI monetary penalties.
- Restrictions on business.
- Criminal prosecution of responsible officers.

Senior management may be held accountable.

---

## 17. Practical Case-Based Understanding

Case 1:

Customer deposits structured cash amounts just below reporting threshold.  
Bank must treat it as suspicious and file STR.

Case 2:

Politically exposed person opens account without enhanced due diligence.  
Regulatory violation may occur.

Case 3:

Bank fails to identify beneficial owner of layered corporate structure.  
May be treated as AML failure.

---

## 18. Important JAIIB Legal Points

- Section 4 provides punishment.
- Chapter IV imposes obligations on banks.
- PML Rules specify record maintenance.

Banks must implement AML framework at:
