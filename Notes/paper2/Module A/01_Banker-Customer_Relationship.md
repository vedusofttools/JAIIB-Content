# Banker–Customer Relationship

MODULE A – GENERAL BANKING OPERATIONS  
JAIIB – Detailed Legal & Conceptual Notes (Beginner Friendly + Case-Oriented)

---

## 1. Introduction

The Banker–Customer relationship is the legal foundation of banking operations. Every service provided by a bank — deposits, loans, remittances, lockers, collections — arises from this relationship.

For JAIIB, this topic is extremely important because:

- It defines legal rights and liabilities.
- It explains when statutory protection applies.
- It forms the base for Negotiable Instruments Act, lien, set-off, garnishee order, secrecy, etc.

The relationship is not fixed. It changes depending on the nature of the transaction.

## 2. Requirements to be Called a Bank

The definition of banking is provided under **Section 5(b) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949**.

Banking means:

Accepting deposits of money from the public for the purpose of lending or investment, repayable on demand or otherwise and withdrawable by cheque, draft, order or otherwise.

From this definition, four essential elements emerge:

1. Acceptance of deposits from the public
2. Deposits must be repayable
3. Deposits must be withdrawable by cheque/draft/order
4. Deposits must be used for lending or investment

If any of these elements is absent, the institution is not legally a bank.

Example:

A finance company that only gives loans but does not accept deposits withdrawable by cheque is not a bank under the Act.

## 3. Meaning of Banker

A banker is an institution engaged in the business of banking as defined above.

Characteristics:

- Accepts public deposits
- Maintains accounts
- Honors cheques
- Engages in lending
- Regulated by RBI

A banker’s obligations are both contractual and statutory.

## 4. Meaning of Customer

There is no statutory definition of “customer.”

Judicial interpretation states:

A customer is a person who has an account with the bank.

Duration is not important. Even a single transaction may establish the relationship once an account is opened.

Example:

If Mr. A opens a savings account today and deposits ₹5,000, he immediately becomes a customer.

A person presenting a cheque without holding an account is not a customer.

## 5. General Relationship – Debtor and Creditor

The primary relationship between banker and customer is that of debtor and creditor.

When a customer deposits money:

- Bank becomes debtor
- Customer becomes creditor

Ownership of deposited money passes to the bank.

The bank can use the funds for lending and investment.

The bank must repay the equivalent amount, not the same currency notes.

Example:

If ₹1,00,000 is deposited, the bank may lend that amount to another borrower. The depositor can demand repayment but not the same physical notes.

Important:

Debt is payable only on demand. Limitation period begins from date of demand.

## 6. Bank as Trustee

The bank acts as trustee when it holds money or property for a specific purpose.

In such cases:

- Bank cannot use funds for its own benefit.
- Funds must be applied strictly as instructed.

Example:

If a customer deposits ₹50,000 specifically for payment of income tax, the bank must use it only for that purpose.

Similarly, trust accounts require strict adherence to trust deed.

In trustee relationship, misuse of funds may result in legal liability.

## 7. Bailee–Bailor Relationship

Under the Indian Contract Act, bailment means delivery of goods for a specific purpose with obligation to return them.

This relationship arises when:

- Documents are kept in safe custody
- Valuables are deposited for safe keeping

Customer is bailor.  
Bank is bailee.

The bank must take reasonable care of the goods.

Example:

If jewellery kept in safe custody is stolen due to negligence in security, bank may be liable.

Bank is not insurer but must exercise prudent care.

---

## 8. Agent–Principal Relationship

The bank acts as agent when it performs services on behalf of customer.

Examples:

- Collecting cheques
- Paying insurance premium
- Executing standing instructions
- Purchasing securities

Customer is principal.  
Bank is agent.

If bank acts negligently in collection, it may lose statutory protection.

---

## 9. Lessor–Lessee Relationship

In case of locker facility:

- Bank is lessor
- Customer is lessee

Customer pays rent for use of locker.

Ownership of locker remains with bank.

Bank must maintain reasonable security as per RBI locker guidelines.

---

## 10. Indemnifier and Indemnified

Indemnity is a promise to compensate for loss.

Banks obtain indemnity in cases such as:

- Issue of duplicate demand draft
- Payment against lost instrument
- Transmission claims

Customer becomes indemnifier.  
Bank becomes indemnified.

If loss arises due to acting on customer’s request, bank can recover from indemnifier.

## 11. Different Deposit Products or Services

Banks offer various deposit products:

Savings Account:
- Interest bearing
- Meant for personal use

Current Account:
- Generally no interest
- Meant for business transactions

Term Deposit:
- Fixed tenure
- Higher interest

Recurring Deposit:
- Periodic deposits
- Lump sum at maturity

All general deposits create debtor–creditor relationship unless earmarked for specific purpose.

## 12. Services to Customers and Investors

Banks provide various services beyond deposits:

- Remittance services (NEFT, RTGS, DD)
- Locker facility
- Collection of cheques
- ATM and digital banking
- Distribution of insurance and mutual funds
- Demat services

Legal relationship varies depending on service.

Example:

Remittance → Agent relationship  
Locker → Lease relationship  
Safe custody → Bailment

## 13. Termination of Banker–Customer Relationship

The relationship may terminate due to:

- Closure of account
- Death of customer
- Insolvency
- Mental incapacity
- Garnishee order
- Notice by either party

After termination, bank must settle dues properly.

---

## 14. Duty of Secrecy

An implied term in banker–customer relationship is confidentiality.

Bank must not disclose customer information except:

- Under compulsion of law
- In public interest
- In bank’s own interest
- With customer’s consent

Breach of secrecy may lead to legal action.

## 15. Conceptual Understanding for JAIIB

The key to mastering this topic is understanding that:

The relationship changes depending on the transaction.

Deposit → Debtor–Creditor  
Specific purpose funds → Trustee  
Safe custody → Bailee  
Collection → Agent  
Locker → Lessor  
Indemnity cases → Indemnifier

Most case-based questions test whether you can identify the correct legal relationship.
