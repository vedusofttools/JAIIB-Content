JAIIB – Detailed Concept Notes (Beginner Friendly, Conceptual & Exam-Oriented)

---

## 1. Introduction

After an account is opened, the bank’s responsibility does not end.  
The operational handling of deposit accounts is equally important.

Improper handling may lead to:

- Regulatory penalties
- Financial loss
- Customer complaints
- Legal disputes

This block covers:

- Salient features of deposit accounts
- Interest on deposit accounts
- Prohibitions and exemptions
- Inoperative accounts and unclaimed deposits
- Operational instructions in joint accounts
- Nomination facility
- Other operational guidelines
- Attachment / Garnishee orders
- Submission of records to statutory authorities

## 2. Salient Features of Deposit Accounts

Each deposit account has specific operational characteristics.

Savings Account:
- Interest bearing.
- Intended for personal use.
- Limited transaction purpose (not for large-scale commercial use).

Current Account:
- Primarily for business use.
- No interest (generally).
- Unlimited transactions allowed.

Term Deposits:
- Fixed tenure.
- Interest paid at contracted rate.
- Premature withdrawal subject to penalty.

Recurring Deposit:
- Fixed periodic deposit.
- Interest applied as per contracted terms.

Operationally, banks must ensure that the usage of account matches its intended purpose.

Example:

If a savings account shows heavy business transactions, the bank must review and possibly convert to current account.

## 3. Interest on Deposit Accounts

Interest on savings accounts is calculated on daily closing balance.

Interest on term deposits depends on:

- Tenure
- Amount
- Contracted rate
- Compounding frequency

Key Operational Rules:

- Interest must be paid strictly as per agreed rate.
- In case of premature withdrawal, penalty rate may apply.
- In case of death of depositor, interest rules change (usually no penalty for premature withdrawal).

Example:

If a fixed deposit is prematurely withdrawn due to death of depositor, banks generally waive penalty.

Banks must display interest rates transparently.

---

## 4. Prohibitions and Exemptions

Certain prohibitions apply to deposit accounts:

- Banks cannot pay interest on current accounts.
- Overdraft not allowed in minor accounts.
- Savings accounts should not be used for commercial business (unless allowed by policy).
- No interest on overdue term deposit beyond maturity unless renewed.

Exemptions may apply in special categories like government accounts or specific schemes.

## 5. Inoperative Accounts and Unclaimed Deposits

An account becomes inoperative when there is no customer-initiated transaction for two years.

Important Points:

- Only customer-initiated transactions count.
- Bank charges or interest credits do not count as operation.

Operational Steps:

- Account should be flagged.
- Enhanced monitoring required.
- Reactivation requires KYC update and proper verification.

Unclaimed Deposits:

If deposit remains unclaimed for 10 years, amount is transferred to Depositor Education and Awareness Fund (DEAF) as per RBI guidelines.

However, customer retains right to claim money from bank even after transfer.

Example:

If a fixed deposit matured 12 years ago and not claimed, it may be transferred to DEAF, but customer can still approach bank for repayment.

## 6. Operational Instructions in Joint Accounts

Mode of operation must be strictly followed.

Common modes:

- Either or Survivor
- Jointly
- Former or Survivor

Operational risk arises if bank deviates from mandate.

Example:

If account is “Jointly” and bank allows single signature withdrawal, bank may be liable.

Upon death of one holder:

- “Either or Survivor” → Survivor can operate.
- “Jointly” → Survivor cannot operate alone unless legal formalities completed.

Proper record maintenance is crucial.

## 7. Nomination Facility – Operational Aspects

Nomination must be offered at account opening.

Important Rules:

- Only one nominee allowed per account.
- Nomination can be changed anytime.
- Nominee receives amount as trustee of legal heirs.

Upon death of account holder:

- Bank pays nominee after verifying identity.
- Payment to nominee discharges bank liability.

However, nominee does not become absolute owner unless legally entitled.

---

## 8. Other Operational Guidelines

Banks must ensure:

- Proper KYC updates periodically.
- Monitoring of unusual transactions.
- Correct classification of accounts.
- Proper record maintenance.
- Adherence to internal control systems.

Specimen signatures must be verified before honoring cheques.

Signature mismatch may lead to dishonor.

## 9. Attachment Orders and Garnishee Orders

A Garnishee Order is issued by court directing bank to freeze account of debtor.

Two stages:

1. Order Nisi – Temporary freeze.
2. Order Absolute – Funds transferred to court.

Important Operational Points:

- Only credit balance can be attached.
- Joint accounts cannot be attached for debt of one holder (subject to legal interpretation).
- Safe custody items cannot be attached unless specifically ordered.

Bank must act promptly upon receipt of court order.

Failure may make bank liable.

## 10. Procedure for Submission of Records to Statutory Authorities

Banks are required to submit records under various laws:

- Income Tax Act
- PMLA
- RBI reporting requirements
- Court summons

However, disclosure must follow legal provisions.

Bank must balance:

- Duty of secrecy
- Compliance with law

Improper disclosure may violate confidentiality obligations.

## 11. Risk Areas in Deposit Operations

Common risk areas:

- Unauthorized withdrawals.
- Forged signatures.
- Dormant account fraud.
- Failure to update KYC.
- Improper nomination handling.

Example:

Fraudsters often target dormant accounts. Hence banks apply stricter controls before reactivation.

---

## 12. Case-Based Understanding

Case 1:

Savings account inactive for 3 years suddenly shows large withdrawal request.  
Bank must conduct enhanced verification.

Case 2:

Joint account “Jointly” operated by one signature.  
Bank may face liability for unauthorized payment.

Case 3:

Nominee claims funds but legal heir disputes.  
Bank’s liability ends upon payment to nominee if done properly.

## 13. Important JAIIB Points

- Inoperative account after 2 years of no customer transaction.
- DEAF transfer after 10 years.
- Interest on savings calculated on daily balance.
- Garnishee attaches only credit balance.
- Nominee is trustee, not ultimate owner.
- Strict adherence to joint operation mandate required.

---

## 14. Conceptual Clarity

Operational handling of deposit accounts is about:

- Protecting customer funds.
- Protecting bank from liability.
- Ensuring regulatory compliance.
- Preventing fraud.

Strong operational discipline reduces legal disputes and enhances customer trust.
