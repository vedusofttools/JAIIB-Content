---

## 1. Introduction

Apart from the normal debtor–creditor relationship, a banker enjoys certain special rights under law. These rights protect the bank’s financial interest and help in recovery of dues.

The important special rights covered in syllabus are:

- Mandate
- Power of Attorney (POA)
- Banker’s Lien
- Right of Set-off
- Right of Appropriation

Understanding these rights is very important because many JAIIB questions are case-based in this area.

## 2. Mandate – Meaning and Legal Nature

A mandate is an authority given by a customer to another person to operate his bank account.

It is governed by general principles of agency under the Indian Contract Act.

### Key Features of Mandate

- It is limited authority.
- It is revocable by the customer.
- It does not transfer ownership of account.
- It is usually used for convenience.

Example:

Mr. A gives written instruction to bank allowing his wife to withdraw money from his savings account.  
The wife acts under mandate.

Important:

Mandate ends automatically on:

- Death of customer
- Insolvency
- Mental incapacity
- Revocation by customer

Bank must record mandate properly before allowing operations.

## 3. Power of Attorney (POA)

Power of Attorney is a legal document by which one person authorizes another to act on his behalf.

Unlike mandate:

- POA is more formal.
- It may be general or specific.
- It may include authority to borrow, sign contracts, etc.

### Types of POA

1. General Power of Attorney – wide powers.
2. Special Power of Attorney – limited to specific acts.

Bank must verify:

- Valid execution of POA.
- Scope of powers.
- Whether borrowing power is included (if applicable).

Example:

If POA does not authorize borrowing, bank should not grant loan to attorney holder.

POA also ceases on:

- Death of principal
- Insolvency
- Revocation

## 4. Banker’s Lien

Lien means right to retain goods until debt is paid.

Under Section 171 of Indian Contract Act, bankers have general lien.

General lien allows banker to retain securities belonging to customer for general balance of account.

### Key Characteristics

- It is a passive right (right to retain).
- It is not automatic right to sell unless contract permits.
- It applies to goods deposited in ordinary course of business.

Example:

If customer owes ₹5 lakh and has pledged securities worth ₹3 lakh, bank can retain those securities until dues are cleared.

## 5. Conditions for Banker’s Lien

Lien can be exercised if:

- Securities are in possession of bank.
- No contract inconsistent with lien exists.
- Debt is due and payable.

Lien cannot be exercised if:

- Securities deposited for safe custody.
- Securities held for specific purpose.
- Trust accounts.

Example:

If customer deposits shares for safe custody only, bank cannot exercise lien.

## 6. Right of Set-off

Right of set-off allows bank to combine accounts of a customer and adjust credit balance against debit balance.

It is based on principles of equity.

### Conditions for Set-off

- Both accounts must be in same name and same capacity.
- Debt must be due and payable.
- No agreement prohibiting set-off.

Example:

If Mr. A has:

- Savings account with ₹1 lakh credit.
- Loan account with ₹80,000 outstanding.

Bank can set off ₹80,000 from savings account against loan.

## 7. Limitation of Set-off

Set-off cannot be exercised if:

- Accounts are in different capacities.
  Example: Personal account and trust account.
- Debt is not yet due.
- Specific contract prohibits it.

Important:

Set-off requires prior notice to customer (as per judicial precedents).

## 8. Difference Between Lien and Set-off

Lien relates to:

Retention of goods or securities.

Set-off relates to:

Adjustment of monetary balances between accounts.

Lien requires possession of securities.  
Set-off relates to account balances.

## 9. Right of Appropriation

Right of appropriation refers to applying payment towards a particular debt.

Under Section 59–61 of Indian Contract Act:

If debtor owes multiple debts and makes payment, he may specify which debt it should be adjusted against.

If debtor does not specify, creditor (bank) may appropriate at its discretion.

If neither specifies, payment is adjusted in order of time (oldest debt first).

Example:

Customer has two loans:

- Personal Loan – ₹1 lakh
- Credit Card – ₹50,000

If customer pays ₹50,000 and specifies “for personal loan”, bank must adjust accordingly.

If no instruction given, bank may decide.

## 10. Practical Case-Based Understanding

Case 1:

Customer deposits documents for safe custody.  
Bank cannot exercise lien.

Case 2:

Customer’s personal account in credit; business loan account in debit.  
Set-off allowed only if both in same capacity.

Case 3:

Customer makes part payment but does not specify loan.  
Bank may appropriate to unsecured or higher interest debt.

Case 4:

After customer’s death, bank attempts set-off.  
Legal position depends on account structure and notice of death.

## 11. Important JAIIB Legal Points

- Section 171 gives banker’s general lien.
- Lien applies unless contract inconsistent.
- Set-off requires same name and same capacity.
- Appropriation governed by Sections 59–61 of Contract Act.
- Mandate and POA cease on death of principal.
- Lien is passive right; sale requires contractual right.

## 12. Conceptual Clarity

Banker’s special rights protect the bank from:

- Credit risk
- Recovery difficulties
- Legal complications

However, these rights are not absolute.

They must be exercised:

- Carefully
- In good faith
- Within legal limits
- Without violating trust relationships

Strong understanding of these rights helps in answering complex JAIIB case-based questions.
