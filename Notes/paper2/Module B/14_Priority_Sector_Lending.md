## 1. Introduction

Priority Sector Lending (PSL) is a regulatory mandate requiring banks to lend a specified portion of their Adjusted Net Bank Credit (ANBC) to identified priority sectors.

Objective:

- Promote inclusive growth
- Support weaker sections
- Improve access to institutional credit

PSL is not optional. It is mandatory under RBI guidelines.

## 2. Applicability of PSL Norms

PSL norms apply to:

- Scheduled Commercial Banks (excluding certain categories)
- Small Finance Banks
- Regional Rural Banks

Different categories of banks may have different targets.

---

## 3. Overall PSL Target

Domestic commercial banks are generally required to lend a specified percentage of ANBC or Credit Equivalent of Off-Balance Sheet Exposure (whichever is higher) to priority sectors.

Failure to achieve targets leads to regulatory consequences.

---

# PART II – TARGETS AND SUB-TARGETS

---

## 4. Sub-Targets under PSL

Within overall PSL, banks must meet sub-targets for:

- Agriculture

Sub-targets ensure balanced credit distribution.

---

## 5. Agriculture Target

Includes:

- Farm credit

Both direct and indirect agricultural lending may be considered.

---

---

## 7. Weaker Sections

Includes:

- Small and marginal farmers
- SHGs

---

# PART IV – NON-ACHIEVEMENT OF PSL TARGETS

---

## 15. Consequences of Non-Compliance

If banks fail to meet PSL targets:

- Required to contribute to specified funds (e.g., RIDF or other funds as per RBI directions).

This acts as penalty mechanism.

---

## 16. RIDF (Rural Infrastructure Development Fund)

Managed by NABARD.

Banks deposit shortfall amount.

Funds used for rural infrastructure projects.

---

# PART V – OTHER MODES OF LENDING

---

## 17. Indirect PSL

Banks may achieve PSL through:

- On-lending to eligible institutions
- Purchase of eligible loan portfolios
- Co-lending models

Compliance must follow RBI norms.

---

## 18. Priority Sector Lending Certificates (PSLC)

Banks can:

- Buy or sell PSLCs
- Meet targets without transferring underlying assets

PSLC is a tradable certificate.

It improves flexibility in meeting targets.

---

# PART VI – CASE-BASED UNDERSTANDING

---

## 19. Case 1

Bank fails to meet agriculture target.

Must contribute shortfall to designated fund.

---

## 20. Case 2

Loan granted to small manufacturing unit within micro limits.

Qualifies under micro enterprise sub-target.

---

## 21. Case 3

Affordable housing loan within specified limit.

Counts under PSL housing category.

---

## 22. Case 4

Bank buys PSLC from another bank.

Can meet target without direct lending increase.

---

# PART VII – IMPORTANT JAIIB POINTS

---

## 23. Key Concepts

- PSL mandatory under RBI guidelines.
- Targets based on ANBC or credit equivalent.
- Sub-targets for agriculture and weaker sections.
- Non-achievement leads to contribution to funds.
- PSLC allows trading of PSL achievement.
- Affordable housing and education loans qualify.
- MSME and agriculture are major components.

---

## 24. Conceptual Clarity

PSL ensures credit flow to underserved sectors.

It balances:

- Profit motive
- Social responsibility

For banks:

PSL compliance is regulatory requirement, not optional strategy.

Understanding targets, categories, and compliance mechanisms is essential for JAIIB.
