Finance to MFIs / Co-Lending Arrangements with NBFCs  
(Scale Based Regulation for NBFCs Included)

MODULE B – FUNCTIONS OF BANKS  
JAIIB – Detailed Notes (Regulatory + Structural + Risk-Oriented)

---

## 1. Introduction

Banks increasingly lend indirectly through:

- NBFCs
- NBFC-MFIs
- Co-lending arrangements

This expands credit outreach, especially to:

- Micro borrowers
- Rural customers
- Priority Sector segments

However, regulatory safeguards are essential to control systemic risk.

---

# PART I – NBFCs AS CREDIT CHANNEL

---

## 2. Meaning of NBFC

Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC):

- Engaged in lending and financial activities
- Does not have banking license
- Cannot accept demand deposits

Regulated by RBI under RBI Act.

NBFCs play major role in credit distribution.

---

## 3. Bank Borrowings – Source of Finance for NBFCs

NBFCs depend heavily on:

- Bank loans
- Debentures
- Market borrowings

Banks provide funding to NBFCs for onward lending.

This creates indirect exposure to end borrowers.

---

## 4. Bank Loans to NBFCs for On-Lending

Banks may lend to NBFCs for:

- MSME financing
- Agriculture
- Housing
- Microfinance

Subject to regulatory conditions.

Certain exposures may qualify under Priority Sector if conditions satisfied.

---

# PART II – NBFC-MFI FRAMEWORK

---

## 5. Meaning of NBFC-MFI

NBFC-MFI is a specialized NBFC providing microfinance loans.

Microfinance loans typically:

- Small ticket size
- Short tenure
- Group-based lending

Focus on low-income households.

---

## 6. Bank Finance to NBFC-MFIs

Banks lend to NBFC-MFIs for:

- On-lending to micro borrowers
- Financial inclusion activities

Exposure may qualify under Priority Sector subject to compliance.

---

## 7. NBFC-MFI as Channelising Agent

NBFC-MFIs often implement:

- Government subsidy schemes
- Micro-credit programs
- SHG-based lending

Banks leverage their local outreach.

---

# PART III – CO-LENDING MODEL

---

## 8. Meaning of Co-Lending

Co-lending is joint lending arrangement between:

- Bank
- NBFC

Both share exposure in a single loan.

Objective:

- Combine bank’s low-cost funds
- NBFC’s reach and credit assessment capability

---

## 9. Structure of Co-Lending

Typically:

- NBFC originates loan
- Bank funds major portion
- Loan held in agreed proportion

Risk shared as per agreement.

---

## 10. Benefits of Co-Lending

- Expands financial inclusion
- Diversifies bank portfolio
- Reduces concentration risk
- Helps meet PSL targets

---

## 11. Risks in Co-Lending

- Operational risk
- Credit risk
- Misalignment of underwriting standards
- Reputation risk

Clear agreement and monitoring essential.

---

# PART IV – SCALE BASED REGULATION (SBR) FOR NBFCs

---

## 12. Introduction to Scale Based Regulation

RBI introduced Scale Based Regulation (SBR) to:

- Strengthen NBFC supervision
- Align regulation with size and risk
- Prevent systemic instability

NBFCs classified into different layers.

---

## 13. Layers Under SBR

1. Base Layer
2. Middle Layer
3. Upper Layer
4. Top Layer (if required)

Higher layer → Stricter regulation.

---

## 14. Regulatory Focus Areas

- Capital adequacy
- Governance standards
- Exposure norms
- Risk management

Banks must evaluate regulatory compliance before lending to NBFCs.

---

# PART V – RISK MANAGEMENT

---

## 15. Credit Risk in Lending to NBFCs

Banks face:

- Concentration risk
- Asset-liability mismatch risk
- Contagion risk

Failure of large NBFC can impact banking system.

---

## 16. Due Diligence Before Lending

Banks must assess:

- Financial statements
- Asset quality
- Liquidity profile
- Management quality
- Regulatory compliance

Exposure limits must be monitored carefully.

---

# PART VI – CASE-BASED UNDERSTANDING

---

## 17. Case 1

Bank lends heavily to single NBFC with weak liquidity.

Systemic risk increases.

---

## 18. Case 2

NBFC-MFI uses bank funds for non-eligible purposes.

PSL classification may be affected.

---

## 19. Case 3

Co-lending arrangement lacks clear risk-sharing agreement.

Recovery complications may arise.

---

## 20. Case 4

NBFC classified in higher regulatory layer under SBR.

Stricter compliance requirements apply.

---

# PART VII – IMPORTANT JAIIB POINTS

---

## 21. Key Concepts

- NBFCs regulated by RBI under RBI Act.
- Banks provide funding for on-lending.
- NBFC-MFIs focus on microfinance.
- Co-lending shares risk between bank and NBFC.
- SBR classifies NBFCs into regulatory layers.
- Higher layer → stricter supervision.
- Proper due diligence essential before exposure.

---

## 22. Conceptual Clarity

Finance to NBFCs and MFIs:

- Enhances credit penetration
- Supports financial inclusion
- Helps achieve PSL targets

However:

Indirect exposure carries layered risk.

Banks must ensure:

- Regulatory compliance
- Adequate risk sharing
- Strong monitoring

This block connects retail inclusion strategy with systemic risk management.
