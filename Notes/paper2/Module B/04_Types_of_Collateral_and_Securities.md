## 1. Introduction

In lending, **security** plays a secondary but crucial role.  
While repayment capacity is primary, collateral provides protection in case of default.

This block explains:

- Secured vs unsecured loans
- Types of securities
- Characteristics of different collateral types
- Risks associated with each

Understanding security types is essential for credit risk management and recovery.

# PART I – SECURED VS UNSECURED LOANS

---

## 2. Secured Loans

A secured loan is backed by specific asset as security.

If borrower defaults:

- Bank can enforce security.
- Bank has legal right over charged asset.

Examples:

- Housing loan secured by property
- Gold loan secured by ornaments
- Vehicle loan secured by vehicle

Secured loans reduce credit risk.

## 3. Unsecured Loans

Unsecured loans are granted without specific collateral.

Example:

- Personal loan (salary based)
- Credit card loans

These depend purely on:

- Borrower’s creditworthiness
- Income stability

Higher risk → Higher interest rate.

# PART III – EFFECTIVENESS OF SECURITIES

---

- Legally enforceable
- Free from encumbrance

Even strong collateral cannot compensate for weak repayment capacity.

Margin = 25%  
Loan = ₹75

Margin protects bank against value fluctuation.

Higher risk assets require higher margin.

## 17. Primary vs Collateral Security

Primary Security:
Asset created from loan (e.g., machinery).

Collateral Security:
Additional asset offered for extra comfort.

Banks often take collateral for large exposures.

---

## 18. Case-Based Understanding

Case 1:

Loan granted against overvalued property.  
Recovery difficult if actual market value lower.

Case 2:

Shares pledged but market crashes sharply.  
Bank’s margin may become inadequate.

Case 3:

Book debts include old receivables beyond credit period.  
Higher risk of default.

Case 4:

Gold loan granted without proper purity testing.  
Security risk increases.

Security should be:

- Adequate
- Legally enforceable
- Properly documented
- Periodically monitored

Understanding characteristics of different securities helps in risk assessment and recovery planning.
