---

## 1. Introduction

Credit appraisal is the process of evaluating a borrower’s creditworthiness before sanctioning a loan.

It is the most critical stage in the credit cycle because:

- Weak appraisal leads to NPAs.
- Strong appraisal ensures asset quality.
- RBI supervisory focus is heavily on appraisal standards.

Credit appraisal applies to:

- Working capital loans
- Term loans
- Project finance
- Retail loans
- MSME loans

## 2. Meaning of Credit Appraisal

Credit appraisal is a detailed assessment of:

- Borrower’s financial strength
- Repayment capacity
- Risk profile
- Project viability
- Security coverage

It answers one key question:

“Will the borrower repay the loan on time?”

---

## 3. Objectives of Credit Appraisal

- Assess repayment capacity
- Identify credit risk
- Ensure compliance with lending policy
- Determine appropriate loan structure
- Protect bank’s funds

Credit appraisal reduces probability of default.

---

## 4. The 5 Cs of Credit

Banks often evaluate credit based on:

1. Character – Integrity and credit history
2. Capacity – Repayment ability
3. Capital – Net worth contribution
4. Collateral – Security offered
5. Conditions – Economic and industry factors

These principles guide appraisal decisions.

---

## 5. Credit Appraisal Techniques

Appraisal techniques differ based on borrower type:

- Ratio analysis
- Cash flow analysis
- Break-even analysis
- Sensitivity analysis
- Credit scoring (retail loans)

Large corporate loans require detailed financial modeling.

---

# PART II – ASSESSMENT OF WORKING CAPITAL

---

## 6. Meaning of Working Capital

Working capital refers to funds required for day-to-day operations.

It covers:

- Raw material
- Work-in-progress
- Finished goods
- Receivables
- Operating expenses

Working capital cycle determines fund requirement.

---

## 7. Operating Cycle Concept

Operating cycle is the time taken between:

Purchase of raw material → Production → Sale → Collection of receivables

Longer cycle means higher working capital requirement.

Example:

If production takes 60 days and receivables are realized in 30 days, operating cycle is 90 days.

---

## 8. Methods of Assessing Working Capital

### (a) Turnover Method (for MSME)

Working capital requirement = Percentage of projected turnover.

Generally applied for smaller units.

---

### (b) MPBF Method (Maximum Permissible Bank Finance)

Traditionally used method based on:

Current Assets – Current Liabilities

Borrower must bring margin (own contribution).

---

### (c) Cash Budget Method

Used for seasonal industries.

Based on:

Projected cash inflows and outflows.

Example:

Agricultural or sugar industry with seasonal cash flows.

---

## 9. Drawing Power (DP)

Drawing Power is the limit up to which borrower can withdraw funds.

DP is calculated based on:

- Value of stock
- Receivables
- Less margin

DP fluctuates periodically based on stock statements.

---

# PART III – ASSESSMENT OF TERM LOAN

---

## 10. Meaning of Term Loan

Term loan is granted for acquisition of fixed assets such as:

- Machinery
- Plant
- Building
- Expansion projects

Repayment is structured over fixed tenure.

---

## 11. Assessment of Term Loan

Assessment focuses on:

- Project cost
- Means of finance
- Promoter’s contribution
- Debt service capacity
- Break-even point

Promoter must contribute adequate margin.

---

## 12. Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR)

DSCR measures ability to repay term loan.

DSCR = Net Operating Income / Total Debt Obligations

Higher DSCR indicates better repayment capacity.

Generally, DSCR above 1 is preferred.

---

## 13. Break-Even Analysis

Break-even point indicates:

Level of sales at which total revenue equals total cost.

Lower break-even point indicates lower risk.

Used in project appraisal.

---

## 14. Sensitivity Analysis

Sensitivity analysis checks impact of:

- Increase in cost
- Decrease in sales
- Change in interest rate

It helps assess project robustness.

---

# PART IV – CREDIT RISK ASSESSMENT

---

## 15. Credit Rating / Risk Grading

Banks assign internal credit rating to borrowers based on:

- Financial performance
- Industry outlook
- Management quality
- Repayment track record

Higher risk → Higher interest rate or rejection.

---

## 16. Assessment of Repayment Capacity (Retail Loans)

For retail borrowers, appraisal includes:

- Income verification
- Credit score (CIBIL)
- Existing obligations
- EMI-to-income ratio

Banks ensure that EMI burden is reasonable.

---

## 17. Documentation & Due Diligence

Appraisal also includes:

- Verification of KYC
- Legal opinion
- Valuation report
- CERSAI search
- Charge registration

Due diligence prevents fraud and legal defects.

---

## 18. Case-Based Understanding

Case 1:

Company shows high profit but negative cash flow.  
Cash flow analysis must be considered before sanction.

Case 2:

Seasonal business applies for working capital.  
Cash budget method may be more suitable.

Case 3:

Term loan proposed but promoter contribution very low.  
Higher leverage increases credit risk.

Case 4:

Borrower’s DSCR below 1.  
Loan may not be viable without restructuring.

---

## 19. Important JAIIB Points

- Credit appraisal evaluates repayment capacity.
- Working capital assessed using operating cycle concept.
- Drawing Power depends on stock and receivables.
- DSCR is key indicator for term loans.
- Promoter’s contribution reduces bank risk.
- Sensitivity analysis tests project viability.
- Risk grading affects pricing.

---

## 20. Conceptual Clarity

Credit appraisal is the foundation of safe lending.

It ensures:

- Quality asset creation
- Risk mitigation
- Regulatory compliance
- Sustainable profitability

Weak appraisal is the starting point of future NPAs.

Strong appraisal protects the bank’s balance sheet.

This block forms the analytical backbone of lending operations.
