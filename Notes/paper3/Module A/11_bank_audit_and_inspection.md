# Bank Audit and Inspection

(Teacher Mode – Practical + Regulatory Focus)

------------------------------------------------------------

# 1. What is Bank Audit?

Audit means:

Systematic examination of books of accounts,
Records and internal controls
To ensure correctness and compliance.

In banks, audit is extremely important because:

- Public money is involved
- Regulatory compliance is mandatory
- Financial stability depends on accuracy

------------------------------------------------------------

# 2. Objectives of Bank Audit

- Verify financial statements
- Ensure compliance with RBI guidelines
- Detect fraud and irregularities
- Evaluate internal controls
- Ensure proper income recognition
- Verify asset classification and provisioning

------------------------------------------------------------

# 3. Types of Bank Audits

Very important for exams.

------------------------------------------------------------

## (1) Statutory Audit

Conducted as per Banking Regulation Act.

Appointed with RBI approval.

Purpose:
- Verify financial statements
- Certify Balance Sheet and Profit & Loss Account
- Ensure compliance with accounting standards

Usually conducted annually.

------------------------------------------------------------

## (2) Concurrent Audit

Continuous audit conducted during the year.

Focus areas:
- Large transactions
- High-risk advances
- Foreign exchange transactions
- Cash transactions

Objective:
Early detection of errors and fraud.

------------------------------------------------------------

## (3) Internal Audit

Conducted by bank’s internal team.

Purpose:
- Evaluate internal control systems
- Check operational efficiency
- Identify process gaps

------------------------------------------------------------

## (4) Risk-Based Internal Audit (RBIA)

Modern audit approach.

Instead of checking everything equally,
Focus is on high-risk areas.

Risk areas may include:

- Credit risk
- Market risk
- Operational risk
- Compliance risk

RBIA improves efficiency of audit process.

------------------------------------------------------------

# 4. Inspection by RBI

RBI conducts inspection of banks under:

Banking Regulation Act, 1949

Inspection focuses on:

- Capital adequacy
- Asset quality
- Management quality
- Earnings
- Liquidity
- Systems and controls

This framework is often called CAMELS approach.

------------------------------------------------------------

# 5. CAMELS Framework

C – Capital Adequacy  
A – Asset Quality  
M – Management  
E – Earnings  
L – Liquidity  
S – Sensitivity to Market Risk

Used to assess overall health of bank.

------------------------------------------------------------

# 6. Role of Audit in Banking

Audit ensures:

- Correct classification of NPAs
- Proper provisioning
- Accurate income recognition
- Compliance with RBI norms
- Transparency in reporting

Without strong audit,
Financial stability is at risk.

------------------------------------------------------------

# 7. Common Audit Observations in Banks

- Incorrect income recognition
- Delay in NPA classification
- Pending reconciliation entries
- Weak internal controls
- Suspense accounts not cleared
- KYC violations

------------------------------------------------------------

# 8. Importance of Concurrent Audit

Concurrent audit is critical because:

- Detects fraud early
- Prevents large losses
- Ensures daily monitoring
- Improves branch discipline

It is especially important in:

- Treasury operations
- Large corporate loans
- Forex transactions

------------------------------------------------------------

# 9. Difference Between Audit and Inspection

Audit:
- Periodic examination
- Focus on financial correctness

Inspection:

Both aim to ensure safety and soundness.

Frequently tested areas:

- Types of audits
- CAMELS framework
- Purpose of concurrent audit
- Risk-based audit concept
- Role of RBI inspection

------------------------------------------------------------

# 11. Common Beginner Mistakes

- Confusing internal audit with statutory audit
- Ignoring purpose of concurrent audit
- Forgetting CAMELS components
- Thinking audit only checks arithmetic accuracy

------------------------------------------------------------

# Quick Revision Points

- Audit = verification + compliance
- Statutory audit is mandatory
- Concurrent audit = continuous monitoring
- RBIA focuses on risk areas
- CAMELS used for inspection
- RBI inspects banks under Banking Regulation Act
