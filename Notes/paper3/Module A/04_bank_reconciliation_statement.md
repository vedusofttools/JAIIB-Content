# Bank Reconciliation Statement (BRS)

(Teacher Mode – Step by Step)

------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. What is a Bank Reconciliation Statement?

A Bank Reconciliation Statement (BRS) is:

A statement prepared to explain the difference between:
- Balance as per Cash Book (Bank Column)
  AND
- Balance as per Pass Book / Bank Statement

In simple words:

Your book says one balance.
Bank’s book says another balance.
BRS explains why.

------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Why Do Differences Occur?

Important:
Cash Book and Pass Book are not always identical.

Because:

Some transactions are recorded:
- In Cash Book first
  OR
- In Pass Book first

Timing difference causes mismatch.

------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. What is Cash Book?

Cash Book is maintained by business.

It records:
- Cash transactions
- Bank transactions

If bank column exists, it acts as bank ledger also.

------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. What is Pass Book / Bank Statement?

Pass Book is maintained by bank.

It records:
- Deposits made
- Cheques issued
- Bank charges
- Interest
- Direct credits

It shows bank’s view of your account.

------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. Is Pass Book Mirror Image of Cash Book?

Not exactly.

If you deposit ₹10,000:

In your Cash Book → Bank column debit  
In Pass Book → Credit entry

Sides are opposite.

But balances should match eventually.

------------------------------------------------------------

# 6. Main Causes of Difference (Very Important)

Let us understand clearly.

------------------------------------------------------------

### (1) Cheques Issued but Not Presented

You issued cheque.
Entered in Cash Book.
But receiver has not presented it yet.

Result:
Cash Book balance reduces.
Pass Book unchanged.

------------------------------------------------------------

### (2) Cheques Deposited but Not Collected

You deposited cheque.
Entered in Cash Book.
Bank has not cleared it yet.

Result:
Cash Book increases.
Pass Book unchanged.

------------------------------------------------------------

### (3) Bank Charges Debited by Bank

Bank deducts charges.
Appears in Pass Book.
Not yet recorded in Cash Book.

------------------------------------------------------------

### (4) Interest Credited by Bank

Bank credits interest.
Appears in Pass Book.
Not recorded in Cash Book.

------------------------------------------------------------

### (5) Direct Deposits by Customers

Customer deposits directly into bank.
Appears in Pass Book.
Business may not know immediately.

------------------------------------------------------------

### (6) Dishonour of Cheque

Cheque deposited but dishonoured.
Bank reverses entry.
Pass Book changes.
Cash Book may not yet reflect.

------------------------------------------------------------

# 7. Need for Bank Reconciliation

Why is BRS necessary?

- Detect errors
- Detect fraud
- Ensure accuracy
- Confirm correct balance
- Internal control

Banks perform reconciliation daily.

------------------------------------------------------------

# 8. Types of Balances

Two types of balances exist:

1. Debit balance (favourable)
2. Credit balance (overdraft)

You must know:
Which balance is given?
Cash Book or Pass Book?

This is crucial for solving numericals.

------------------------------------------------------------

# 9. Steps to Prepare BRS

Step 1:
Start with balance given (Cash Book or Pass Book)

Step 2:
Add items that increase the other book

Step 3:
Subtract items that decrease the other book

Step 4:
Arrive at matching balance

------------------------------------------------------------

# 10. Example (Simple Numerical)

Balance as per Cash Book: ₹50,000

Cheques issued but not presented: ₹5,000  
Bank charges not recorded: ₹1,000

Start with Cash Book balance: 50,000

Add:
Cheques issued but not presented → 5,000  
(They reduce cash book but not pass book)

Subtract:
Bank charges → 1,000  
(They reduce pass book but not cash book)

Pass Book Balance = 54,000

------------------------------------------------------------

# 11. Adjusting the Cash Book

Sometimes exam gives:

"Adjust Cash Book first"

This means:

Update Cash Book for:
- Bank charges
- Interest
- Direct credits
- Dishonour

Then prepare BRS only for timing differences.

------------------------------------------------------------

# 12. When Extracts of Both Books are Given

Steps:

1. Identify missing entries
2. Update cash book
3. Then reconcile
4. Ensure final balances match

This is commonly asked in exams.

------------------------------------------------------------

# 13. Advantages of Bank Reconciliation

- Improves internal control
- Detects fraud
- Ensures accounting accuracy
- Maintains financial discipline
- Essential for audit

------------------------------------------------------------

# 14. Important Exam Points

- Cheque issued not presented → Add when starting from Cash Book
- Cheque deposited not cleared → Subtract when starting from Cash Book
- Bank charges → Subtract from Cash Book balance
- Direct deposit → Add to Cash Book balance

Always check:
From which balance are you starting?

------------------------------------------------------------

# Common Beginner Mistakes

- Forgetting starting balance type
- Confusing add/subtract logic
- Ignoring overdraft cases
- Not adjusting cash book first

------------------------------------------------------------

# Quick Revision Formula

Starting Balance
+ Items added in other book  
  – Items deducted in other book  
  = Reconciled Balance
