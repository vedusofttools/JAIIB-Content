# MODULE A – ULTRA REVISION SHEET
(Accounting Principles & Processes)

============================================================
1. ACCOUNTING BASICS
   ============================================================

Accounting = Recording + Classifying + Summarising + Reporting.

Purpose:
- Ascertain profit/loss
- Know financial position
- Decision-making
- Legal compliance

------------------------------------------------------------

Key Concepts:

Business Entity → Business separate from owner  
Going Concern → Business will continue  
Accrual → Record when incurred/earned  
Revenue Recognition → When earned, not when received  
Conservatism → Anticipate losses, not profits  
Historical Cost → Record at purchase price

Accounting Equation:
Assets = Liabilities + Capital

------------------------------------------------------------

Ind AS → Indian Accounting Standards (aligned with IFRS)  
IFRS → Global principle-based standards  
US GAAP → Rule-based standards

Transfer Pricing → Pricing between related entities.

============================================================
2. TYPES OF ACCOUNTS & GOLDEN RULES
   ============================================================

Personal:
Debit the receiver
Credit the giver

Real:
Debit what comes in
Credit what goes out

Nominal:
Debit expenses/losses
Credit incomes/gains

Double Entry:
Every transaction has 2 effects.
Debit = Credit.

============================================================
3. JOURNAL & LEDGER
   ============================================================

Journal = Book of original entry  
Ledger = Account-wise classification

Subsidiary Books:
- Cash Book
- Purchase Book
- Sales Book
- Bills Receivable
- Bills Payable

Cash Book acts as Journal + Ledger.

============================================================
4. BANK RECONCILIATION STATEMENT (BRS)
   ============================================================

Purpose:
Match Cash Book balance with Pass Book balance.

Common Differences:

Cheques issued not presented → Add (when starting from Cash Book)  
Cheques deposited not cleared → Subtract  
Bank charges → Subtract  
Interest credited → Add  
Direct deposit → Add  
Dishonour → Subtract

Exam Rule:
Always check starting balance type (Cash/Pass).

============================================================
5. TRIAL BALANCE & ERRORS
   ============================================================

Trial Balance:
List of ledger balances.
Checks arithmetic accuracy.

Agreement ≠ No errors.

Types of Errors:

Omission → Not recorded  
Commission → Wrong posting  
Principle → Wrong classification  
Compensating → Errors cancel each other

Suspense Account:
Temporary account for mismatch.

============================================================
6. ADJUSTING ENTRIES
   ============================================================

Outstanding Expense:
Expense A/c Dr
To Outstanding A/c

Prepaid Expense:
Prepaid A/c Dr
To Expense A/c

Accrued Income:
Accrued Income A/c Dr
To Income A/c

Depreciation:
Depreciation A/c Dr
To Asset / Provision A/c

============================================================
7. DEPRECIATION
   ============================================================

Depreciation = Allocation of asset cost over useful life.

SLM Formula:
(Cost – Residual Value) / Useful Life

WDV Formula:
Book Value × Rate

SLM → Equal amount  
WDV → Reducing amount

Amortisation → Intangible assets

Depreciation reduces profit.

============================================================
8. CAPITAL vs REVENUE
   ============================================================

Capital Expenditure:
- Long-term benefit
- Creates asset
- Balance Sheet

Revenue Expenditure:
- Short-term benefit
- P&L Account

Quick Test:
Benefit > 1 year? → Capital  
Routine expense? → Revenue

Loan received → Capital receipt  
Sales → Revenue receipt

============================================================
9. BILLS OF EXCHANGE
   ============================================================

Bill = Written order to pay.

Parties:
Drawer
Drawee
Payee

3 Days Grace added for maturity.

Discounting Entry:
Bank Dr
Discount Dr
To Bills Receivable

Dishonour:
Debtor Dr
To Bills Receivable

Accommodation Bill:
No real trade; for temporary finance.

============================================================
10. BANK ACCOUNTING BASICS
    ============================================================

Deposits → Liability  
Loans → Asset

Interest:
Accrual basis (except NPAs)

NPA → Income recognised on cash basis only.

Investment Categories:
HTM
AFS
HFT

============================================================
11. BACK OFFICE & RECONCILIATION
    ============================================================

Back Office:
Processing + Reconciliation + Control.
