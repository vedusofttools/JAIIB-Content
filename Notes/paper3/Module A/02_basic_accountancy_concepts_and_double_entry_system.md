# Basic Accountancy Concepts and Double Entry System

(Teacher Mode – Beginner Friendly)

------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. What is an Account?

An account is simply:

A record of financial transactions
Related to a particular person, asset, expense or income.

Example:
- Cash Account
- Salary Account
- Rent Account
- Bank Account
- Furniture Account

Each account tells a financial story of that item.

------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Types of Accounts (Very Important)

There are three main types of accounts:

1. Personal Account
2. Real Account
3. Nominal Account

Let us understand clearly.

---

### (A) Personal Account

Relates to:
- Persons
- Companies
- Banks
- Institutions

Examples:
- Ram Account
- SBI Bank Account
- ABC Pvt Ltd Account

Golden Rule:
Debit the Receiver  
Credit the Giver

---

### (B) Real Account

Relates to:
- Assets
- Property
- Tangible or intangible items

Examples:
- Cash
- Furniture
- Land
- Machinery

Golden Rule:
Debit what comes in  
Credit what goes out

---

### (C) Nominal Account

Relates to:
- Expenses
- Losses
- Income
- Gains

Examples:
- Salary
- Rent
- Commission
- Interest

Golden Rule:
Debit all expenses and losses  
Credit all incomes and gains

------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Double Entry System (Core of Accounting)

This is the heart of accounting.

Every transaction affects:
At least two accounts.

And:

Total Debit = Total Credit

This keeps accounts balanced.

---

### Example 1:
Business purchases furniture for ₹10,000 cash.

Two effects:
- Furniture increases (asset comes in)
- Cash decreases (asset goes out)

Entry:
Furniture A/c   Dr  10,000  
To Cash A/c         10,000

Why?
Furniture came in → Debit  
Cash went out → Credit

---

### Example 2:
Business pays salary ₹5,000.

Two effects:
- Salary expense increases
- Cash decreases

Entry:
Salary A/c   Dr  5,000  
To Cash A/c     5,000

Salary is expense → Debit  
Cash goes out → Credit

------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Going Concern Concept

This concept assumes:

Business will continue in future.

So:
- Assets are not valued at selling price.
- Depreciation is calculated over useful life.

If business is closing, accounting treatment changes.

This concept is fundamental in banking also.

------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. Entity Concept

Business and owner are separate.

If owner withdraws ₹20,000:
It is not expense.
It is drawings.

Owner’s personal expenses are not business expenses.

This prevents confusion.

------------------------------------------------------------

## 6. Accrual Basis vs Cash Basis

This is VERY important for exams.

---

### Cash Basis

Record income and expenses:
Only when cash is received or paid.

Example:
Salary received in April for March.
Under cash basis → recorded in April.

---

### Accrual Basis

Record income and expenses:
When they are earned or incurred.

Example:
Salary for March recorded in March.
Even if paid in April.

Banks follow accrual system.

------------------------------------------------------------

## 7. Revenue Recognition

Revenue is recognised when:

- It is earned
- Not when cash is received

Example:
Goods sold on credit → revenue recorded immediately.

This ensures correct profit measurement.

------------------------------------------------------------

## 8. Realisation Concept

Profit is recorded only when:

- It is actually realised
- Not when it is expected

Example:
Increase in market value of land is not profit
Until sold.

------------------------------------------------------------

## 9. Principle of Conservatism

Very important in banking.

It means:

- Provide for expected losses
- Do not record anticipated profits

Example:
Provision for doubtful debts.

Banks create:
- Provision for NPAs
- Provision for bad loans

This protects financial statements.

------------------------------------------------------------

## 10. Accounting Equation

The entire accounting system is based on:

Assets = Liabilities + Capital

This equation always balances.

Example:
If owner invests ₹1,00,000 cash:

Assets (Cash) = 1,00,000  
Capital = 1,00,000

Balanced.

If business takes loan ₹50,000:

Assets increase  
Liabilities increase

Still balanced.

------------------------------------------------------------

## 11. Why Double Entry is Important in Banking

Banks deal with:
- Deposits
- Loans
- Interest
- Provisions

Each transaction affects multiple accounts.

Double entry ensures:
- Accuracy
- Detection of errors
- Reliable financial statements

------------------------------------------------------------

# Common Beginner Mistakes

- Forgetting that every transaction has two effects
- Debiting income instead of crediting

------------------------------------------------------------
