# Books of Accounts and Journalising

(Beginner Friendly – Step-by-Step Teaching)

------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. Why Do We Maintain Books of Accounts?

Imagine a business doing 50 transactions daily.

If we don’t record them properly:
- We forget payments
- We miss receipts
- Profit calculation becomes wrong
- Fraud risk increases

Books of accounts help to:
- Record transactions systematically
- Classify them properly
- Summarise financial information
- Prepare financial statements

In banks, book-keeping must be extremely accurate.

------------------------------------------------------------

# 2. Record Keeping Basics

Every financial transaction must have:

1. Evidence (invoice, bill, voucher)
2. Date
3. Amount
4. Parties involved

Only transactions measurable in money are recorded.

Example:
Hiring honest employee → Not recorded
Paying salary → Recorded

------------------------------------------------------------

# 3. Debit and Credit Concepts (Very Important)

Many beginners fear debit and credit.

Let us simplify.

Debit (Dr) does NOT always mean decrease.
Credit (Cr) does NOT always mean increase.

It depends on account type.

------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick Revision of Rules

Personal Account:
Debit the receiver  
Credit the giver

Real Account:
Debit what comes in  
Credit what goes out

Nominal Account:
Debit expenses/losses  
Credit incomes/gains

------------------------------------------------------------

# 4. Journal – The Book of Original Entry

The Journal is the first book where transactions are recorded.

It is called:
Book of Original Entry.

Every transaction is first recorded in journal.

Format:

Date | Particulars | Debit Amount | Credit Amount

------------------------------------------------------------

## Example 1:
Owner started business with ₹2,00,000 cash.

Entry:

Cash A/c        Dr  2,00,000  
To Capital A/c       2,00,000

Explanation:
Cash comes in → Debit  
Capital increases → Credit

------------------------------------------------------------

## Example 2:
Purchased goods on credit from Ram ₹50,000.

Purchase A/c    Dr  50,000  
To Ram A/c           50,000

Explanation:
Goods purchased → Expense → Debit  
Ram is giver → Credit

------------------------------------------------------------

## Example 3:
Paid electricity bill ₹5,000.

Electricity A/c   Dr  5,000  
To Cash A/c            5,000

Electricity → Expense → Debit  
Cash goes out → Credit

------------------------------------------------------------

# 5. Ledger – The Principal Book

Journal records transactions chronologically (date-wise).

Ledger classifies them account-wise.

Each account has separate page in ledger.

Example:
Cash Ledger
Salary Ledger
Ram Ledger

Ledger helps to:
- Know total of each account
- Prepare Trial Balance

------------------------------------------------------------

# 6. Posting from Journal to Ledger

Process:

1. Record transaction in journal.
2. Transfer (post) it to respective ledger accounts.

Example:

Journal Entry:
Salary A/c Dr  10,000  
To Cash A/c     10,000

Posting:

Salary Account:
Debit side → 10,000

Cash Account:
Credit side → 10,000

------------------------------------------------------------

# 7. Subsidiary Books (Specialised Books)

When transactions increase, journal becomes bulky.

So we maintain specialised books:

- Cash Book
- Purchase Book
- Sales Book
- Purchase Return Book
- Sales Return Book
- Bills Receivable Book
- Bills Payable Book

This makes accounting efficient.

------------------------------------------------------------

# 8. Cash Book

Cash book records:

- Cash transactions
- Bank transactions (sometimes)

Types:

1. Single Column Cash Book
2. Double Column Cash Book
3. Triple Column Cash Book (Cash + Bank + Discount)

Important:
Cash book acts as both Journal and Ledger.

------------------------------------------------------------

# 9. Columnar Accounting Mechanics

Columnar means:
Multiple columns used to separate details.

Example:
Cash | Bank | Discount

This helps:
- Faster recording
- Clear classification
- Easy reconciliation

Banks heavily use columnar systems.

------------------------------------------------------------

# 10. Classification of Accounts in Modern Terms

In modern accounting, accounts are classified as:

1. Assets
2. Liabilities
3. Equity
4. Income
5. Expenses

But golden rules still apply.

------------------------------------------------------------

# 11. Importance in Banking

Banks maintain:

- Day books
- Subsidiary ledgers
- Customer ledgers
- General ledger

Accuracy is critical because:
- Depositors’ money is involved
- RBI inspections occur
- Audit verification required

------------------------------------------------------------

# Common Beginner Mistakes

- Forgetting dual effect
- Posting wrong side in ledger
- Confusing capital with income
- Treating purchase of asset as expense

------------------------------------------------------------

# Quick Revision Points

- Journal = first entry
- Ledger = classification
- Cash book = special journal + ledger
- Every transaction → Debit = Credit
- Subsidiary books reduce workload
