# Depreciation and Its Accounting

(Teacher Mode – Clear Concepts + Numerical Understanding)

------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. What is Depreciation?

Depreciation is:

Gradual reduction in the value of a fixed asset
Due to use, passage of time or obsolescence.

Example:
- Machinery wears out.
- Vehicles lose value.
- Computers become outdated.

Depreciation is NOT a loss of cash.
It is allocation of cost over useful life.

------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Why Do We Provide Depreciation?

Very important question.

Reasons:

1. To show true profit.
2. To allocate cost over useful life.
3. To follow matching principle.
4. To reflect correct asset value.
5. For tax purposes.

Without depreciation,
Profit will be overstated.

------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Causes of Depreciation

- Wear and tear
- Obsolescence (technology outdated)
- Passage of time
- Exhaustion (mines, natural resources)
- Accidents

------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Factors Affecting Depreciation

1. Cost of asset
2. Useful life
3. Residual (scrap) value
4. Method of depreciation

------------------------------------------------------------

# 5. Accounting Entries for Depreciation

Two methods of recording:

------------------------------------------------------------

## (A) Direct Method

Depreciation A/c Dr  
To Asset A/c

Asset value reduces directly.

------------------------------------------------------------

## (B) Provision Method

Depreciation A/c Dr  
To Provision for Depreciation A/c

Asset remains at original cost.
Provision account accumulates depreciation.

Provision method is widely used.

------------------------------------------------------------

# 6. Methods of Depreciation

Very important for exams.

------------------------------------------------------------

## (1) Straight Line Method (SLM)

Same amount of depreciation every year.

Formula:

Depreciation = (Cost – Residual Value) / Useful Life

------------------------------------------------------------

### Example:

Machine cost = ₹1,00,000  
Residual value = ₹10,000  
Useful life = 5 years

Depreciation per year:

(1,00,000 – 10,000) / 5  
= 90,000 / 5  
= ₹18,000 per year

Every year ₹18,000 charged.

------------------------------------------------------------

## Advantages of SLM

- Simple
- Easy to calculate
- Equal charge every year

## Disadvantages

- Not realistic for assets losing value faster early
- Ignores usage level

------------------------------------------------------------

## (2) Written Down Value (WDV) Method

Also called:
Diminishing Balance Method

Depreciation charged on:
Book value each year.

Formula:

Depreciation = Book Value × Rate

------------------------------------------------------------

### Example:

Asset cost = ₹1,00,000  
Rate = 20%

Year 1:
Depreciation = 1,00,000 × 20% = 20,000  
Book value = 80,000

Year 2:
Depreciation = 80,000 × 20% = 16,000  
Book value = 64,000

Depreciation decreases every year.

------------------------------------------------------------

## Advantages of WDV

- Realistic
- Higher charge in early years
- Suitable for machinery

## Disadvantages

- More complex
- Asset value never becomes zero fully

------------------------------------------------------------

## (3) Units of Production Method

Depreciation based on:
Actual usage.

Example:
Machine expected to produce 1,00,000 units.

Depreciation per unit calculated.
Useful when output varies.

------------------------------------------------------------

## (4) Sum of Years’ Digits Method

Accelerated method.

More depreciation in early years.
Less in later years.

Less common in India.

------------------------------------------------------------

# 7. Replacement of Fixed Asset

When asset is replaced:

Old asset is removed from books.
Profit or loss on sale calculated.

Entry:

Cash A/c Dr  
Provision for Depreciation A/c Dr  
To Asset A/c  
To Profit on Sale A/c (if any)

------------------------------------------------------------

# 8. Sinking Fund Method

Used when business wants to:

Set aside money annually
To replace asset in future.

Money is invested each year.
Used for large assets.

------------------------------------------------------------

# 9. Amortisation of Intangible Assets

Intangible assets:
- Goodwill
- Patent
- Trademark

Their cost is written off gradually.
This process is called Amortisation.

Example:
Patent valid for 10 years.
Cost spread over 10 years.

------------------------------------------------------------

# 10. Importance in Banking

Banks apply depreciation to:

- Furniture
- Computer systems
- Buildings
- ATM machines

Correct depreciation ensures:

- True profit
- Correct asset value
- Compliance with regulations

------------------------------------------------------------

# 11. Common Beginner Mistakes

- Treating depreciation as cash expense
- Ignoring residual value
- Confusing SLM with WDV
- Forgetting to reduce book value in WDV

------------------------------------------------------------

# Quick Revision Points

- Depreciation = allocation of cost
- SLM → Equal amount
- WDV → Reducing amount
- Depreciation affects profit
- Amortisation for intangible assets
