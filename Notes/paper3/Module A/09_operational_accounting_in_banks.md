# Operational Aspects of Accounting in Banks

(Teacher Mode – Banking Practical Orientation)

------------------------------------------------------------

# 1. Peculiar Features of Accounting System in Banks

Bank accounting is different from normal business accounting because:

Banks deal in:
- Money as commodity
- Public deposits
- Loans and advances
- Interest income
- Regulatory norms

Accuracy is extremely critical.

------------------------------------------------------------

# 2. Major Differences Between Normal Business and Bank Accounting

Normal Business:
- Sells goods/services
- Maintains purchase & sales accounts
- Inventory is main asset

Bank:
- Accepts deposits
- Gives loans
- Interest is main income
- Deposits are liabilities

Important understanding:

In bank balance sheet:
Deposits are shown as liabilities.

------------------------------------------------------------

# 3. Nature of Bank Transactions

Banks handle:

- Cash deposits
- Cash withdrawals
- Loan disbursement
- EMI collection
- Interest accrual
- Investment in securities

Each transaction has double effect.

------------------------------------------------------------

# 4. Deposits in Bank Accounting

Customer deposit increases:

Bank’s liability.

Entry:

Cash A/c Dr  
To Customer Deposit A/c

Why liability?

Because bank owes that money to customer.

------------------------------------------------------------

# 5. Loans and Advances

When bank gives loan:

Loan is asset for bank.

Entry:

Loan A/c Dr  
To Cash A/c

Loan generates interest income.

------------------------------------------------------------

# 6. Interest Accounting in Banks

Banks follow accrual system.

Interest on loans:

Interest Accrued A/c Dr  
To Interest Income A/c

Even if not received.

However:
For NPAs (Non Performing Assets),
Interest is not recognised on accrual basis.

This is very important in banking.

------------------------------------------------------------

# 7. NPA Accounting (Basic Idea)

When loan becomes NPA:

- Interest income is not recognised.
- Income is booked only when actually received.

This follows prudence principle.

------------------------------------------------------------

# 8. Investment Accounting in Banks

Banks invest in:

- Government securities
- Bonds
- Treasury bills

These are classified as:

- Held to Maturity (HTM)
- Available for Sale (AFS)
- Held for Trading (HFT)

Different valuation rules apply.

------------------------------------------------------------

# 9. Core Banking System (CBS)

Modern banks use:

Centralised accounting system.

All branches are connected.
Entries are posted centrally.

This ensures:

- Real-time updates
- Faster reconciliation
- Better monitoring

------------------------------------------------------------

# 10. Branch Accounting in Banks

Earlier:

Each branch maintained separate books.

Now:

CBS integrates all branches.

Still:
Inter-branch accounts exist internally.

------------------------------------------------------------

# 11. Illustration (Simple Example)

Customer deposits ₹1,00,000 in bank.

Entry:

Cash A/c Dr 1,00,000  
To Customer Deposit A/c 1,00,000

Bank gives loan ₹50,000.

Loan A/c Dr 50,000  
To Cash A/c 50,000

Bank earns interest ₹5,000 accrued.

Interest Accrued A/c Dr 5,000  
To Interest Income A/c 5,000

------------------------------------------------------------

# 12. Importance of Accurate Bank Accounting

Incorrect accounting may affect:

- Profit
- Capital adequacy ratio
- RBI compliance
- Public confidence

Hence banks have:

- Internal audit
- Concurrent audit
- Risk-based audit

------------------------------------------------------------

# 13. Key Risk Areas in Bank Accounting

- NPA recognition
- Income recognition
- Provisioning
- Inter-branch reconciliation
- Suspense entries

------------------------------------------------------------

# 14. Why This Topic is Important for JAIIB?

Questions may test:

- Why deposits are liabilities
- How loans are assets
- Interest recognition in NPAs
- Difference between bank and business accounting
- Investment classification

------------------------------------------------------------

# Quick Revision Points

- Deposits = liability
- Loans = asset
- Interest accrual concept
- NPAs follow prudence
- CBS centralises accounting
- Investment categories (HTM, AFS, HFT)
