# Financial Mathematics – Forex Arithmetic

============================================================

## 1. Meaning of Foreign Exchange (Forex)

Foreign Exchange means:

Conversion of one currency into another.

Forex market facilitates:

- International trade
- Investment flows
- Remittances
- Currency speculation

============================================================

## 2. Indian Forex Market

In India:

- Regulated by RBI
- Governed under FEMA, 1999
- Authorised Dealers (AD banks) handle forex transactions

============================================================

## 3. Exchange Rate

Exchange Rate is:

Price of one currency expressed in another currency.

Example:

1 USD = ₹83

Means ₹83 required to buy 1 USD.

============================================================

## 4. Direct and Indirect Quote

------------------------------------------------------------

Direct Quote:

Foreign currency expressed in terms of domestic currency.

Example (India):
1 USD = ₹83

------------------------------------------------------------

Indirect Quote:

Domestic currency expressed in terms of foreign currency.

Example:
₹1 = 0.012 USD

India generally follows Direct Quote system.

============================================================

## 5. Bid and Ask Rate

Bid Rate:
Rate at which bank buys foreign currency.

Ask Rate:
Rate at which bank sells foreign currency.

Important:

Ask Rate > Bid Rate

Difference = Spread (Bank's profit margin)

============================================================

## 6. Basic Forex Arithmetic

------------------------------------------------------------

Example 1:

USD/INR = 83.00 / 83.20

Bank buys USD at ₹83.00  
Bank sells USD at ₹83.20

If customer wants to buy USD:
Use Ask rate → 83.20

If customer wants to sell USD:
Use Bid rate → 83.00

============================================================

## 7. Cross Rate Calculation

Used when direct quote not available.

Example:

USD/INR = 83  
EUR/USD = 1.10

To find EUR/INR:

EUR/INR = EUR/USD × USD/INR

= 1.10 × 83  
= 91.30

============================================================

## 8. Forward Exchange Rate

Forward rate is:

Rate agreed today
For currency exchange at future date.

Used for hedging exchange risk.

------------------------------------------------------------

Forward Premium:
Forward rate > Spot rate

Forward Discount:
Forward rate < Spot rate

============================================================

## 9. Forward Premium Calculation

Formula:

Forward Premium (%) =
(Forward Rate – Spot Rate) / Spot Rate × 100

============================================================

## 10. Exchange Rate Appreciation & Depreciation

If USD/INR moves:

83 → 85

Rupee depreciates
USD appreciates

If USD/INR moves:

83 → 80

Rupee appreciates
USD depreciates

============================================================

## 11. Example – Import Payment

Importer needs $10,000  
USD/INR = 83.20

Amount payable:

10,000 × 83.20  
= ₹8,32,000

============================================================

## 12. Example – Export Receipt

Exporter receives $5,000  
USD/INR = 83.00

Amount received:

5,000 × 83.00  
= ₹4,15,000

============================================================

## 13. Importance in Banking

Banks use forex arithmetic for:

- Trade finance
- Remittances
- Hedging
- Treasury operations

Forex risk management is critical.

============================================================

## 14. Common Exam Focus Areas

- Direct vs indirect quote
- Bid vs ask
- Spread calculation
- Cross rate calculation
- Forward premium/discount
- Currency appreciation/depreciation

============================================================

# Quick Recall

Bid → Bank buys  
Ask → Bank sells  
Ask > Bid

Cross rate = Multiply appropriately  
Forward premium if forward > spot
