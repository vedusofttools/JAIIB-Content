# Ratio Analysis

============================================================

## 1. Meaning of Accounting Ratios

Ratio is:

A mathematical relationship between two accounting figures.

It helps in:

- Analysing financial performance
- Assessing liquidity
- Measuring profitability
- Evaluating solvency
- Comparing companies

Formula:

Ratio = One Financial Figure / Another Related Figure

============================================================

## 2. Objectives of Ratio Analysis

- Evaluate financial health
- Compare performance over time
- Compare with competitors
- Assist investors and lenders
- Support management decisions

============================================================

## 3. Classification of Ratios

Ratios are broadly classified into:

1. Liquidity Ratios
2. Profitability Ratios
3. Solvency (Leverage) Ratios
4. Activity (Efficiency) Ratios

============================================================

# 4. Liquidity Ratios

Measure short-term paying capacity.

------------------------------------------------------------

### (1) Current Ratio

Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities

Ideal Ratio: 2 : 1

Indicates ability to pay short-term obligations.

------------------------------------------------------------

### (2) Quick Ratio (Acid Test Ratio)

Quick Ratio = (Current Assets – Inventory) / Current Liabilities

Ideal Ratio: 1 : 1

Inventory excluded because it may not be easily liquidated.

============================================================

# 5. Profitability Ratios

Measure earning capacity.

------------------------------------------------------------

### (1) Gross Profit Ratio

Gross Profit Ratio = Gross Profit / Sales × 100

Indicates core profitability.

------------------------------------------------------------

### (2) Net Profit Ratio

Net Profit Ratio = Net Profit / Sales × 100

Shows overall profitability.

------------------------------------------------------------

### (3) Return on Capital Employed (ROCE)

ROCE = EBIT / Capital Employed × 100

Capital Employed = Total Assets – Current Liabilities

Measures efficiency of capital usage.

------------------------------------------------------------

### (4) Return on Equity (ROE)

ROE = Net Profit / Shareholders’ Equity × 100

Measures return to shareholders.

============================================================

# 6. Solvency (Leverage) Ratios

Measure long-term financial stability.

------------------------------------------------------------

### (1) Debt-Equity Ratio

Debt-Equity Ratio = Total Debt / Shareholders’ Equity

Indicates financial risk.

Higher ratio → Higher financial risk.

------------------------------------------------------------

### (2) Interest Coverage Ratio

Interest Coverage Ratio = EBIT / Interest

Shows ability to pay interest.

Higher ratio is safer.

============================================================

# 7. Activity (Efficiency) Ratios

Measure efficiency in using assets.

------------------------------------------------------------

### (1) Inventory Turnover Ratio

Inventory Turnover = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory

Higher ratio indicates better efficiency.

------------------------------------------------------------

### (2) Debtors Turnover Ratio

Debtors Turnover = Credit Sales / Average Debtors

Shows speed of collection.

------------------------------------------------------------

### (3) Asset Turnover Ratio

Asset Turnover = Sales / Total Assets

Measures asset utilisation efficiency.

============================================================

# 8. Interpretation of Ratios

Ratio alone is not sufficient.

Interpretation depends on:

- Industry standards
- Past performance
- Economic conditions
- Company size

Comparison is key.

============================================================

# 9. Users of Ratio Analysis

Investors:
Interested in profitability and returns.

Lenders:
Interested in liquidity and solvency.

Management:
Interested in efficiency and performance.

Creditors:
Interested in short-term liquidity.

============================================================

# 10. Limitations of Ratio Analysis

- Based on historical data
- Ignores qualitative factors
- Different accounting policies distort comparison
- Inflation impact ignored
- Window dressing possible

============================================================

# 11. Simple Numerical Example

Current Assets = 5,00,000  
Current Liabilities = 2,50,000

Current Ratio = 5,00,000 / 2,50,000  
= 2 : 1

Indicates strong liquidity.

============================================================

# 12. Important Exam Focus Areas

- Current ratio and quick ratio formula
- Debt-equity interpretation
- ROCE formula
- Interest coverage ratio
- Limitations of ratio analysis
- Users and their perspective

============================================================

Quick Recall:

Liquidity → Short-term strength  
Profitability → Earning capacity  
Solvency → Long-term stability  
Efficiency → Asset utilisation
