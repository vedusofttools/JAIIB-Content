Differences analysed
And corrective action taken.

============================================================

## 8. Advantages of Budgetary Control

- Better planning
- Improved coordination
- Cost control
- Performance monitoring
- Early detection of problems

============================================================

## 9. Limitations of Budgetary Control

- Based on estimates
- Time-consuming
- Rigid if not flexible
- May discourage innovation

============================================================

# 10. Installation of Budgetary Control System

Steps:

1. Define objectives
2. Set budget period
3. Identify budget centres
4. Prepare budgets
5. Compare actual vs budget
6. Analyse deviations

============================================================

# 11. Zero-Based Budgeting (ZBB)

Under ZBB:

Every expense
Must be justified from zero.

No automatic carry forward of previous budget.

Useful for:

Cost reduction
Eliminating unnecessary expenses.

============================================================

Links:

Budget with performance.

Results and output.

============================================================

## 14. Important Exam Focus Areas

- Fixed vs flexible budget difference
- Cash budget purpose
- Budgetary control meaning
- Zero-based budgeting concept
- Advantages & limitations
- Programme vs performance budgeting

============================================================

# Quick Recall

Budget = Future plan  
Flexible budget adjusts  
ZBB starts from zero  
Budgetary control = Compare & correct
