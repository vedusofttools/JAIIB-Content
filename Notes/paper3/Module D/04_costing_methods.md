# Costing Methods

============================================================

## 1. Unit and Output Costing

Unit Costing is used when:

- Single product is produced
- Continuous production
- Homogeneous product

Examples:

- Cement
- Sugar
- Bricks

Cost per Unit = Total Cost / Total Units Produced

============================================================

# 2. Job Costing

Used when:

- Work is done as per specific customer order
- Each job is different

Examples:

- Construction projects
- Printing press
- Tailoring

------------------------------------------------------------

## Job Cost Card

A document that records:

- Direct materials
- Direct labour
- Direct expenses
- Allocated overheads

Total job cost is calculated for each job separately.

------------------------------------------------------------

### Allocation of Overheads

Overheads distributed on basis of:

- Labour hours
- Machine hours
- Direct labour cost

============================================================

# 3. Batch Costing

Batch costing is:

Extension of job costing.

Used when:

- Similar items produced in batches.

Examples:

- Pharmaceuticals
- Garments
- Bakery items

Cost per unit = Total batch cost / Number of units in batch

============================================================

# 4. Contract Costing

Used for:

- Large contracts
- Long-term projects

Examples:

- Building construction
- Road projects
- Bridges

------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

- Long duration
- Large amount
- Progress payments
- Retention money

------------------------------------------------------------

### Retention Money

Part of payment retained
Until contract completion.

------------------------------------------------------------

### Escalation Clause

Clause to revise contract price
If material or labour cost increases.

------------------------------------------------------------

### Contract Profit

Profit recognised based on:

Stage of completion.

============================================================

# 5. Process Costing

Used when:

- Mass production
- Continuous process
- Identical products

Examples:

- Oil refinery
- Chemical industry
- Paper production

------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

- Output of one process becomes input of next.
- Cost accumulated for each process.

============================================================

## Process Loss

------------------------------------------------------------

Normal Loss:
Expected loss.

Abnormal Loss:
Unexpected loss.

Abnormal Gain:
Actual loss less than normal loss.

============================================================

## Equivalent Units

Used when:

- Work-in-progress exists.

Equivalent units convert incomplete units
Into fully completed units.

============================================================

## Inter-Process Profit

Profit added while transferring
From one process to another.

Used for internal performance evaluation.

============================================================

# 6. Joint Products and By-Products

Joint Products:

Two or more products produced simultaneously.

Example:

Petroleum refining.

By-Product:

Secondary product
Having lower value.

============================================================

# 7. Service Costing

Used in service industries.

Examples:

- Transport
- Hospitals
- Hotels

Cost unit depends on service:

- Per kilometer
- Per patient
- Per room per day

============================================================

# 8. Multiple Costing

Combination of:

More than one costing method.

Used in:

Automobile industry.

============================================================

# 9. Identification of Cost Unit

Cost unit must be:

- Measurable
- Standardised
- Relevant to product/service

============================================================

# 10. Important Exam Focus Areas

- Job vs Process costing difference
- Batch costing formula
- Normal vs abnormal loss
- Retention money meaning
- Escalation clause
- Equivalent units concept
- Joint product vs by-product

============================================================

# Quick Recall

Job → Specific order  
Batch → Group production  
Process → Continuous production  
Contract → Long-term project  
Normal loss expected  
Abnormal loss unexpected
