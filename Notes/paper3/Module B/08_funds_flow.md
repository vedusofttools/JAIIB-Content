2. Funds Flow Statement (Sources & Application)

============================================================

# 5. Statement of Changes in Working Capital

Prepare a table:

List current assets and liabilities
For two years
Find increase or decrease

------------------------------------------------------------

### Rules:

Increase in Current Asset → Increase in Working Capital  
Decrease in Current Asset → Decrease in Working Capital

Increase in Current Liability → Decrease in Working Capital  
Decrease in Current Liability → Increase in Working Capital

============================================================

# 6. Sources of Funds

Sources increase long-term funds.

Examples:

- Issue of shares
- Long-term loan
- Sale of fixed assets
- Funds from operations
- Decrease in working capital

============================================================

# 7. Application of Funds

Applications reduce long-term funds.

Examples:

- Purchase of fixed assets
- Loan repayment
- Dividend payment
- Increase in working capital

============================================================

# 8. Funds from Operations

Funds from operations means:

Profit adjusted for non-cash items.

Formula:

Net Profit
+ Non-cash expenses (Depreciation)  
  – Non-operating incomes

============================================================

# 9. Example (Simple Understanding)

Balance Sheet Data:

Year 1 Working Capital = ₹1,00,000  
Year 2 Working Capital = ₹1,20,000

Increase = ₹20,000

This ₹20,000 is Application of Funds.

Because more money is tied up in working capital.

============================================================

# 10. Example (Working Capital Calculation)

Year 1:

Current Assets = 2,00,000  
Current Liabilities = 1,00,000

Working Capital = 1,00,000

Year 2:

Current Assets = 2,50,000  
Current Liabilities = 1,30,000

Working Capital = 1,20,000

Increase = 20,000

Application of funds = 20,000

============================================================

# 11. Difference Between Cash Flow and Funds Flow

Cash Flow:

- Focuses only on cash
- Short-term liquidity
- Prepared under accounting standards

Funds Flow:

- Focuses on working capital
- Broader financial movement
- Not mandatory under modern standards

============================================================

# 12. Important Exam Logic

- Treating increase in working capital as source
- Ignoring non-cash adjustments in funds from operations
