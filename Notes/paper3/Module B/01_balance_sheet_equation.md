# Balance Sheet Equation


============================================================

## 1. What is Balance Sheet?

A Balance Sheet is:

A statement showing
Financial position of a business
At a specific date.

It shows:

Assets  
Liabilities  
Capital

It answers one question:

"What does the business own and what does it owe?"

============================================================

## 2. Balance Sheet Equation (Very Important)

The entire accounting system is based on this equation:

Assets = Liabilities + Capital

This is also called:

Accounting Equation

This equation must ALWAYS balance.

============================================================

## 3. Meaning of Each Component

------------------------------------------------------------

### Assets

Assets are:

Resources owned by business
Having economic value

Examples:
- Cash
- Bank balance
- Machinery
- Furniture
- Debtors
- Building

Assets give future benefit.

------------------------------------------------------------

### Liabilities

Liabilities are:

Obligations of business
Amount payable to outsiders

Examples:
- Loans
- Creditors
- Bank overdraft
- Outstanding expenses

Liabilities represent outside claims.

------------------------------------------------------------

### Capital

Capital is:

Owner’s claim on business.

It represents:

Owner’s investment + retained profit

Capital = Assets – Liabilities

============================================================

## 4. Expanded Accounting Equation

Sometimes written as:

Assets = Liabilities + Capital + Income – Expenses – Drawings

Because:

Profit increases capital  
Expenses reduce capital  
Drawings reduce capital

============================================================

## 5. How Transactions Affect Equation

Every transaction affects at least two elements
But equation remains balanced.

Let us understand step by step.

------------------------------------------------------------

### Example 1:
Owner starts business with ₹1,00,000 cash.

Assets increase (Cash) → 1,00,000  
Capital increases → 1,00,000

Equation:

Assets = 1,00,000  
Liabilities = 0  
Capital = 1,00,000

Balanced.

------------------------------------------------------------

### Example 2:
Business purchases furniture for ₹20,000 cash.

Cash decreases  
Furniture increases

Assets change internally.

Before:
Cash = 1,00,000

After:
Cash = 80,000  
Furniture = 20,000

Total Assets still = 1,00,000

Equation unchanged.

------------------------------------------------------------

### Example 3:
Business takes bank loan ₹50,000.

Assets increase (Cash)  
Liabilities increase (Loan)

New position:

Assets = 1,50,000  
Liabilities = 50,000  
Capital = 1,00,000

Balanced.

------------------------------------------------------------

### Example 4:
Business pays salary ₹10,000.

Cash decreases  
Capital decreases (expense reduces profit)

Assets = 1,40,000  
Liabilities = 50,000  
Capital = 90,000

Still balanced.

============================================================

## 6. Computation of Balance Sheet Equation (Numerical Format)

Example:

Owner invests ₹2,00,000  
Purchases goods ₹50,000 cash  
Takes loan ₹1,00,000  
Pays rent ₹10,000

Let us compute step-by-step.

------------------------------------------------------------

Step 1:
Capital = 2,00,000  
Assets (Cash) = 2,00,000

------------------------------------------------------------

Step 2:
Goods purchase → Asset change

Cash = 1,50,000  
Inventory = 50,000

Assets = 2,00,000

------------------------------------------------------------

Step 3:
Loan taken ₹1,00,000

Cash = 2,50,000  
Loan = 1,00,000

Assets = 3,00,000  
Liabilities = 1,00,000  
Capital = 2,00,000

------------------------------------------------------------

Step 4:
Rent paid ₹10,000

Cash = 2,40,000  
Capital reduces by 10,000

Final Position:

Assets:
Cash = 2,40,000  
Inventory = 50,000  
Total = 2,90,000

Liabilities:
Loan = 1,00,000

Capital:
1,90,000

Check:

Assets = 2,90,000  
Liabilities + Capital = 1,00,000 + 1,90,000  
= 2,90,000

Balanced.

============================================================

## 7. Important Rules for Exams

✔ Assets increase → Either capital increases or liability increases or another asset decreases  
✔ Expense reduces capital  
✔ Income increases capital  
✔ Loan increases liability  
✔ Drawings reduce capital

============================================================

## 8. Why This Is Important for Banking?

For banks:

Deposits = Liability  
Loans given = Asset  
Interest income increases capital  
Provision reduces capital

Entire bank balance sheet follows this equation.

============================================================

## 9. Common Beginner Mistakes

- Thinking deposits are assets (for bank they are liabilities)
- Ignoring impact of expenses on capital
- Forgetting that internal asset changes do not affect total
- Mixing capital and liability

============================================================

## 10. Quick Rapid Recall

Accounting Equation:
Assets = Liabilities + Capital

Capital = Assets – Liabilities

Every transaction keeps equation balanced.
