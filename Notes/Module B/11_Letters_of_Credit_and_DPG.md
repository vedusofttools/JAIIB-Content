## 1. Introduction

Letters of Credit (LC) are essential instruments in trade finance.

They:

- Facilitate domestic and international trade
- Reduce counterparty risk
- Assure payment to seller

Banks play a central role in LC transactions.

Deferred Payment Guarantees (DPG) are related instruments used in long-term trade and project contracts.

This block is important for understanding non-fund based facilities in trade finance.

# PART I – LETTERS OF CREDIT (LC)

---

## 2. Meaning of Letter of Credit

A Letter of Credit is a written undertaking by a bank to pay the seller (beneficiary) on behalf of the buyer (applicant), provided specified documents are presented as per terms.

LC substitutes bank’s creditworthiness for buyer’s creditworthiness.

---

## 3. Parties to a Letter of Credit

1. Applicant – Buyer/importer
2. Beneficiary – Seller/exporter
3. Issuing Bank – Bank issuing LC
4. Advising Bank – Bank advising LC to beneficiary
5. Confirming Bank (if any) – Adds its own guarantee

Understanding parties is crucial for exam questions.

---

## 4. Nature of LC

LC is:

- Independent of underlying contract
- Document-based, not goods-based
- Binding commitment of bank

Bank deals only with documents, not with quality of goods.

---

## 5. Types of Letters of Credit

### (a) Revocable LC
Can be amended or cancelled without notice (rare in practice).

### (b) Irrevocable LC

Most commonly used.

---

### (c) Confirmed LC

## 6. Documents Under LC

Common documents required:

- Commercial Invoice
- Bill of Lading
- Insurance Policy
- Packing List
- Certificate of Origin

Bank must verify documents strictly as per LC terms.

Even minor discrepancy may lead to refusal.

---

## 7. UCPDC 600

Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits (UCP 600) governs international LC transactions.

Issued by International Chamber of Commerce (ICC).

Key Principles:

- Banks deal with documents only.
- Strict compliance rule.
- Time limit for examination of documents.

Most international LCs are subject to UCP 600.

---

## 8. Examination of Documents

Issuing bank must examine documents carefully.

If discrepancy found:

- Inform beneficiary within prescribed time.
- Seek waiver from applicant.

Failure to notify discrepancy in time may bind bank to pay.

---

## 9. Payment Under LC – Primary Obligation

Bank’s obligation to pay is independent.

If documents comply:

Bank must pay even if buyer disputes quality of goods.

Exception only in case of fraud.

# PART II – DEFERRED PAYMENT GUARANTEE (DPG)

---

## 10. Meaning of Deferred Payment Guarantee

DPG is a guarantee given by bank to pay supplier at future date for goods supplied on deferred payment terms.

Common in:

- Capital goods import
- Large project contracts

---

## 11. Purpose of DPG

- Facilitates long-term supplier credit
- Protects seller against buyer default
- Supports project financing

Bank guarantees payment after agreed period.

---

## 12. Method of Payment in DPG

Payment may be structured as:

- Installments
- Lump sum at future date

Bank becomes liable if borrower fails to pay as per schedule.

---

# PART III – RISK AND PRECAUTIONS

---

## 13. Risks in LC Operations

- Document fraud

---

## 14. Precautions Before Issuing LC

Bank must:

- Assess applicant’s financial capacity
- Fix appropriate limit
- Obtain margin
- Verify trade transaction
- Ensure compliance with FEMA (for imports)

---

## 15. Precautions in DPG

Before issuing DPG:

- Evaluate borrower’s long-term repayment capacity

- Monitor installment schedule

DPG creates contingent liability for bank.

---

# PART IV – CASE-BASED UNDERSTANDING

---

## 16. Case 1

Documents presented strictly as per LC terms, but goods defective.

Bank must pay because obligation is document-based.

---

## 17. Case 2

Minor discrepancy in invoice amount.

Bank may refuse payment unless waiver obtained.

---

## 18. Case 3

Court may restrain bank from payment.

---

## 19. Case 4

# PART V – IMPORTANT JAIIB POINTS

---

## 20. Key Concepts

- LC substitutes bank’s credit for buyer’s credit.
- LC is independent contract.
- Banks deal in documents, not goods.
- UCP 600 governs international LCs.
- Strict compliance rule applies.
- DPG supports long-term supplier credit.
- Fraud is limited exception to payment obligation.

---

## 21. Conceptual Clarity

Letters of Credit reduce trade risk by:

- Assuring payment to seller
- Protecting buyer against non-shipment

Bank guarantee ensures performance or payment.

LC and DPG both create contingent liability for bank.

Strong understanding of independence principle and document-based obligation is essential for JAIIB.
