Contracts of Guarantee & Bank Guarantee

MODULE B – FUNCTIONS OF BANKS  
JAIIB – Detailed Notes (Legal + Practical + Risk-Oriented)

---

## 1. Introduction

Contracts of Guarantee are extremely important in banking because:

- Many loans are backed by personal or corporate guarantees.
- Bank guarantees are widely used in trade and infrastructure.
- Guarantor liability is frequently tested in JAIIB.

Guarantee strengthens the bank’s recovery position but must be properly understood and documented.

# PART I – CONTRACT OF GUARANTEE

---

## 2. Definition (Section 126 – Indian Contract Act, 1872)

A contract of guarantee is a contract to perform the promise, or discharge the liability, of a third person in case of his default.

There are three parties:

1. Principal Debtor
2. Creditor
3. Surety (Guarantor)

The person giving guarantee is called Surety.

---

## 3. Consideration in Guarantee

Anything done or any promise made for the benefit of the principal debtor is sufficient consideration for the surety.

Example:

If bank grants loan to borrower at request of guarantor, the loan itself is valid consideration for guarantee.

---

## 4. Liability of Surety

Under Section 128:

Liability of surety is co-extensive with that of principal debtor, unless otherwise provided in the contract.

This means:

- Surety is liable for full amount.
- Bank can proceed directly against surety without first exhausting remedies against borrower.

This is a very important JAIIB concept.

---

## 5. Continuing Guarantee

A continuing guarantee extends to a series of transactions.

Example:

Guarantee for cash credit limit.

It remains valid until revoked.

---

## 6. Revocation of Continuing Guarantee

Continuing guarantee may be revoked:

- By notice of surety (for future transactions)
- By death of surety (unless otherwise provided)

Revocation does not affect past transactions.

---

## 7. Discharge of Surety

Surety may be discharged if:

- Terms of contract are varied without consent.
- Principal debtor is released.
- Creditor acts negligently causing loss of security.
- Misrepresentation or concealment by creditor.

Variation in loan terms without guarantor’s consent may discharge surety.

---

## 8. Forbearance to Sue

If creditor merely delays legal action against debtor, surety is not discharged.

But if creditor enters into binding agreement releasing debtor, surety may be discharged.

---

## 9. Surety’s Rights Against Principal Debtor

After paying debt, surety can:

- Recover amount from principal debtor.
- Step into shoes of creditor (right of subrogation).
- Claim benefit of securities held by creditor.

---

## 10. Co-Sureties

If multiple guarantors exist:

- Liability shared equally unless contract states otherwise.
- Release of one co-surety does not discharge others.

---

# PART II – BANK GUARANTEE

---

## 11. Meaning of Bank Guarantee (BG)

Bank Guarantee is a commitment given by bank to pay beneficiary in case of default by its customer.

Parties involved:

- Applicant (bank’s customer)
- Beneficiary
- Bank

Bank acts as guarantor.

---

## 12. Types of Bank Guarantees

1. Financial Guarantee – Ensures repayment of money.
2. Performance Guarantee – Ensures performance of contract.
3. Bid Bond Guarantee
4. Advance Payment Guarantee

Each type serves different commercial purpose.

---

## 13. Nature of Bank Guarantee

Bank guarantee is:

- Independent contract between bank and beneficiary.
- Separate from underlying contract between applicant and beneficiary.

Bank must honor guarantee if invocation is as per terms.

---

## 14. Banker’s Duty to Honour Guarantee

If invocation is proper and within validity:

Bank must pay without investigating underlying dispute.

Exception:

Fraud of egregious nature or irretrievable injustice.

Courts rarely interfere in unconditional guarantees.

---

## 15. Counter-Indemnity

Before issuing BG, bank takes:

Counter-indemnity from customer.

If bank pays beneficiary, customer must reimburse bank.

This protects bank financially.

---

## 16. Precautions Before Issuance of Bank Guarantee

Bank must:

- Assess customer’s creditworthiness.
- Obtain adequate margin.
- Verify purpose and terms.
- Ensure proper documentation.
- Set validity period.

Issuance without appraisal increases risk.

---

## 17. Precautions at Time of Payment

Before honoring BG:

- Verify invocation as per terms.
- Check expiry date.
- Confirm compliance with conditions.

Improper refusal may damage bank’s reputation.

Improper payment may cause financial loss.

---

# PART III – CASE-BASED UNDERSTANDING

---

## 18. Case 1

Loan terms modified without guarantor’s consent.

Guarantor may claim discharge due to variance in contract.

---

## 19. Case 2

Bank delays suing borrower.

Surety not discharged merely due to delay.

---

## 20. Case 3

Unconditional bank guarantee invoked.

Bank must pay even if customer disputes underlying contract.

---

## 21. Case 4

Fraud established in invocation of guarantee.

Court may restrain bank from making payment.

---

# PART IV – IMPORTANT JAIIB POINTS

---

## 22. Key Concepts

- Guarantee defined under Section 126.
- Surety’s liability is co-extensive (Section 128).
- Continuing guarantee covers series of transactions.
- Variation without surety’s consent discharges surety.
- Bank guarantee is independent contract.
- Bank must honor unconditional guarantee.
- Counter-indemnity protects bank.

---

## 23. Conceptual Clarity

Guarantee strengthens credit security by adding third-party liability.

Bank Guarantee differs from normal guarantee because:

- Bank becomes guarantor.
- It is independent of underlying contract.
- It carries strong commercial credibility.

Understanding difference between indemnity and guarantee is essential:

Indemnity → Two parties, primary liability.  
Guarantee → Three parties, secondary liability.

This block is heavily tested in case-based format.
