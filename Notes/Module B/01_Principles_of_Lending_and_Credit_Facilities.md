Principles of Lending & Types of Credit Facilities

MODULE B – FUNCTIONS OF BANKS  
JAIIB – Detailed Notes (Conceptual + Practical + Risk-Oriented)

---

## 1. Introduction

Lending is the primary income-generating activity of a bank.  
While deposits form liabilities, loans and advances form assets.

Sound lending is essential for:

- Profitability
- Asset quality
- Risk control
- Financial stability

Therefore, banks follow well-established **Principles of Lending** to ensure safe and productive credit deployment.

# PART I – PRINCIPLES OF LENDING

---

## 2. Safety

Safety means:

The borrower must have the ability and intention to repay the loan.

Banks must evaluate:

- Financial strength
- Repayment capacity
- Character of borrower
- Stability of income

Example:

A borrower with stable salary and clean credit history is safer than a borrower with irregular income.

Safety focuses on repayment, not just collateral.

---

## 3. Liquidity

Liquidity means:

The bank should be able to recover the loan within reasonable time if needed.

Short-term loans provide higher liquidity than long-term loans.

Example:

Working capital loan is more liquid than a 15-year housing loan.

Banks must balance liquidity and profitability.

---

## 4. Profitability

Loans must generate adequate return.

Profitability depends on:

- Interest rate
- Cost of funds
- Risk premium
- Administrative cost

Banks price loans based on:

- Credit risk
- Tenure
- Market conditions

Higher risk borrowers are charged higher interest.

---

## 5. Purpose

Loan must be granted for a lawful and productive purpose.

Banks must verify:

- End use of funds
- Viability of project
- Compliance with regulations

Loans for speculative or illegal purposes must be avoided.

---

## 6. Diversification

Banks must avoid concentration of risk.

Diversification includes:

- Industry-wise spread
- Geographical spread
- Borrower-wise limits
- Sectoral exposure limits

Excessive exposure to one borrower or sector increases risk.

---

## 7. Security

Security provides fallback in case of default.

However:

Security is secondary.  
Primary focus must be repayment capacity.

Types of security:

- Primary security (asset financed)
- Collateral security

Example:

In vehicle loan, vehicle is primary security.  
Additional property mortgage may be collateral.

---

## 8. National Interest

Banks must align lending with:

- Government policies
- Priority sector norms
- Economic development

Example:

Priority Sector Lending targets for agriculture, MSME, weaker sections.

---

# PART II – TYPES OF BORROWERS

## 9. Individual Borrowers

Examples:

- Salaried persons

Assessment based on income and repayment capacity.

---

## 10. Non-Individual Borrowers

Includes:

- Sole proprietorship
- Partnership firms
- Companies

- Societies

Assessment depends on:

- Financial statements

Legal documentation differs by borrower type.

# PART III – TYPES OF CREDIT FACILITIES

In fund-based facilities, bank actually disburses funds.

Major types:

### (a) Cash Credit (CC)

- Working capital facility

Used for day-to-day business needs.

---

### (b) Overdraft (OD)

- Interest charged on overdrawn amount

Usually flexible facility.

---

### (c) Term Loan

- Loan for fixed period
- Repayable in installments
- Used for asset purchase or project finance

Example:

Machinery loan for 5 years.

---

### (d) Demand Loan

- Repayable on demand
- No fixed repayment schedule
- Often secured by deposits or securities

---

# PART IV – NON-FUND BASED FACILITIES

---

## 12. Meaning of Non-Fund Based Facilities

Bank does not immediately disburse funds.

Instead, bank gives guarantee or commitment.

Examples:

- Bank Guarantee
- Letter of Credit

These create contingent liability.

---

## 13. Bank Guarantee (BG)

Bank promises to pay beneficiary if borrower defaults.

Types:

- Financial Guarantee
- Performance Guarantee

No immediate fund outflow unless invoked.

---

## 14. Letter of Credit (LC)

Used in trade transactions.

Bank guarantees payment to seller on behalf of buyer upon submission of documents.

Ensures smooth trade operations.

---

# PART V – WORKING CAPITAL FACILITIES

---

## 15. Working Capital Finance

Working capital is required for:

- Purchase of raw materials
- Payment of wages
- Inventory holding
- Receivables

Working capital facilities include:

- Cash Credit
- Overdraft
- Bills Discounting

Assessment based on operating cycle.

---

# PART VI – TERM FINANCE

---

## 16. Term Loans

---

## 17. Risk Considerations in Credit Facilities

Banks evaluate:

- Credit risk
- Market risk
- Operational risk

- Management risk

Sound credit appraisal prevents future NPAs.

---

## 18. Case-Based Understanding

Case 1:

Businessman requests loan for speculative land purchase.  
Bank must examine legality and risk.

Case 2:

Company already highly leveraged seeks additional working capital.  
Diversification and exposure norms apply.

Case 3:

Customer with fixed deposit seeks overdraft.  
Lower risk due to secured nature.

---

## 19. Important JAIIB Points

- Safety is the primary principle of lending.
- Security is secondary to repayment capacity.
- Cash Credit is working capital facility.
- Term loan is repayable in installments.
- Bank Guarantee is non-fund based facility.
- Diversification reduces credit risk.
- National interest influences lending policy.

---

## 20. Conceptual Clarity

Principles of lending are designed to balance:

- Profitability
- Liquidity
- Safety

Credit facilities must be structured carefully to prevent asset quality deterioration.

Strong adherence to lending principles ensures:

- Lower NPAs
- Sustainable growth
- Regulatory compliance

This block forms the base for credit appraisal, NPA classification, and recovery laws in subsequent chapters.
