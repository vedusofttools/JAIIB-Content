Documentation in Bank Lending

MODULE B – FUNCTIONS OF BANKS  
JAIIB – Detailed Notes (Legal + Procedural + Risk-Oriented)

---

## 1. Introduction

Documentation is the legal foundation of lending.

Even if appraisal is strong and security is adequate, poor documentation can make recovery impossible.

Proper documentation ensures:

- Legal enforceability
- Clear rights and obligations
- Valid creation of charge
- Protection during litigation

In banking, it is often said:

“A bad loan may still be recovered with strong documentation.  
A good loan may fail due to weak documentation.”

# PART I – PURPOSE OF DOCUMENTATION

---

## 2. Objectives of Loan Documentation

- Establish legal relationship
- Define repayment terms
- Create valid charge over security
- Protect bank’s rights
- Provide evidence in court

Without proper documents, bank’s claim may be legally weak.

# PART II – TYPES OF DOCUMENTS

## 3. Demand Promissory Note (DPN)

A Demand Promissory Note is a written promise to pay a specified amount on demand.

Features:

- Signed by borrower
- Unconditional promise
- Legally enforceable under Negotiable Instruments Act

DPN strengthens bank’s legal position.

---

## 4. Loan Agreement

Loan agreement contains:

- Loan amount
- Interest rate
- Repayment schedule
- Covenants
- Default clauses

It defines contractual relationship between bank and borrower.

---

## 5. Hypothecation Agreement

Used when security is movable property and possession remains with borrower.

Common in:

- Vehicle loans
- Working capital loans

It gives bank right to seize asset in case of default.

---

## 6. Pledge Agreement

Used when possession of goods is transferred to bank.

Common in:

- Gold loans
- Warehouse finance

Bank obtains right of sale after giving notice.

---

## 7. Mortgage Deed

Used for immovable property.

May be:

- Registered mortgage deed
- Equitable mortgage (deposit of title deeds)

Mortgage deed gives bank enforceable right over property.

---

## 8. Guarantee Agreement

When third party guarantees repayment.

Guarantee agreement must clearly mention:

- Liability of guarantor
- Extent of guarantee
- Whether continuing guarantee

Guarantor’s liability is co-extensive with borrower unless otherwise specified.

---

## 9. Letter of Continuity

Used along with Demand Promissory Note.

Purpose:

To keep DPN valid for continuous transactions (e.g., cash credit).

Prevents technical invalidity.

---

## 10. Revival Letter

Used to extend limitation period.

If borrower acknowledges debt before expiry of limitation, fresh limitation period starts.

Very important for recovery.

---

# PART III – DOCUMENTATION PROCEDURE

---

## 11. Execution of Documents

Documents must be:

- Properly stamped
- Signed by all parties
- Witnessed where required
- Dated correctly

Improper execution may invalidate document.

---

## 12. Stamping of Documents

Stamping is governed by Indian Stamp Act.

Unstamped or insufficiently stamped document may:

- Not be admissible in court
- Require penalty payment

Bank must ensure correct stamp duty.

---

## 13. Registration of Documents

Certain documents require registration:

- Mortgage of immovable property (if not equitable mortgage)
- Charges in case of companies

Failure to register may affect enforceability.

---

## 14. Safe Custody of Documents

Banks must maintain:

- Fire-proof safe
- Document tracking system
- Access control

Loss of original documents can cause serious recovery problems.

---

# PART IV – COMMON DOCUMENTATION ERRORS

---

## 15. Common Mistakes

- Missing signatures
- Incorrect borrower name
- Wrong property description
- Insufficient stamp duty
- Failure to obtain guarantor signature
- Non-registration of charge

Such errors weaken bank’s legal position.

---

## 16. Documentation for Different Borrowers

Documentation differs for:

- Individual borrower
- Partnership firm
- Company
- Trust
- Society

For companies:

- Board resolution required
- ROC charge registration mandatory

For partnership:

- Partnership deed must be verified

---

## 17. Legal Opinion & Valuation

Before accepting property as security:

- Legal opinion required to confirm clear title
- Valuation report required to assess market value

These are part of due diligence.

---

# PART V – LIMITATION PERIOD

---

## 18. Law of Limitation

Under Limitation Act:

Time limit for filing recovery suit generally begins from date of default or demand.

Acknowledgment of debt before expiry restarts limitation period.

Hence revival letters are important.

---

## 19. Case-Based Understanding

Case 1:

Loan granted but mortgage deed not registered.  
Bank may face difficulty in enforcing property rights.

Case 2:

Guarantor did not sign guarantee document properly.  
Guarantee may become unenforceable.

Case 3:

Revival letter not obtained before limitation expiry.  
Legal suit may become time-barred.

Case 4:

Incorrect borrower name mentioned in document.  
Recovery litigation may face technical objections.

---

## 20. Important JAIIB Points

- Documentation ensures legal enforceability.
- DPN is negotiable instrument.
- Hypothecation differs from pledge.
- Mortgage relates to immovable property.
- Stamp duty is mandatory.
- Revival letter extends limitation.
- Charge registration essential for companies.

---

## 21. Conceptual Clarity

Credit risk does not end at sanction.

Legal risk arises from poor documentation.

Strong documentation ensures:

- Legal protection
- Enforceable security
- Faster recovery
- Better audit compliance

In recovery proceedings, documents are the primary evidence.

Proper documentation is therefore the backbone of safe banking operations.
