MODULE B – FUNCTIONS OF BANKS  
JAIIB – Detailed Notes (Regulatory + Operational + Risk-Oriented)

---

## 1. Introduction

After sanction and disbursement, a loan enters the operational phase.  
Operational management of loan accounts is critical because:

- Poor monitoring leads to slippages.
- Weak documentation leads to recovery issues.
- Incorrect interest application leads to disputes.
- Non-compliance leads to regulatory penalties.

Operational discipline ensures asset quality and compliance.

# PART I – INTEREST RATES ON LOANS

---

## 2. Interest Rate Framework

Banks determine lending rates based on:

- Cost of funds
- Operating cost
- Risk premium
- Regulatory guidelines

Loans are generally linked to external or internal benchmarks.

Floating rate loans are common in retail and MSME segments.

---

## 3. Types of Interest Rates

### (a) Fixed Rate
Interest remains constant throughout tenure.

### (b) Floating Rate
Interest varies with benchmark changes.

### (c) Hybrid Rate
Combination of fixed and floating.

Banks must clearly disclose rate structure to borrower.

## 4. Penal Interest / Penal Charges

Penal charges may be levied for:

- Delay in repayment
- Default in installments
- Breach of loan terms

However:

Penal interest must not be used as revenue tool.  
RBI emphasizes transparency and fairness.

# PART II – CREDIT MANAGEMENT

---

## 5. Credit Monitoring

Monitoring ensures that:

- Loan is used for intended purpose.
- Security value remains adequate.
- Financial performance remains stable.
- Early warning signals are detected.

Monitoring includes:

- Stock statements
- Financial statement review
- Site visits
- Periodic audits

---

## 6. Early Warning Signals (EWS)

Common warning signals:

- Irregular account operations
- Frequent overdrawing
- Delayed submission of financials
- Cheque returns
- Decline in sales

Early detection helps prevent NPA.

---

## 7. Review and Renewal of Limits

Working capital limits must be:

- Reviewed annually
- Renewed after performance assessment
- Adjusted based on financial changes

Delay in renewal may cause account irregularity.

# PART III – OPERATIONAL TERMS IN LOAN FUNCTIONS

---

## 8. Common Operational Terms

Sanction Limit:
Maximum amount approved.

Drawing Power (DP):
Permissible withdrawal limit based on security.

Margin:
Borrower’s contribution.

Primary Security:
Asset financed by loan.

Collateral Security:
Additional security.

Covenants:
Conditions imposed on borrower.

Understanding these terms is crucial for operational control.

---

## 9. Disbursement Process

Before disbursement:

- Documentation must be complete.
- Security creation must be confirmed.
- Insurance must be valid.
- Compliance with sanction conditions ensured.

Improper disbursement increases legal risk.

---

## 10. Post-Disbursement Compliance

After disbursement, bank must:

- Monitor end-use of funds.
- Verify insurance coverage.
- Track repayment schedule.
- Update records regularly.

---

# PART IV – ACCOUNTING ASPECTS OF LOANS

---

## 11. Loan Account Classification

Loan accounts are classified as:

- Standard Asset
- Sub-standard Asset
- Doubtful Asset
- Loss Asset

Classification depends on repayment performance.

Income recognition norms apply strictly.

---

## 12. Accrual vs Non-Accrual

Interest on standard accounts is recognized on accrual basis.

Interest on NPA accounts must not be recognized on accrual basis.

It can be booked only on actual realization.

This prevents inflated income reporting.

---

## 13. EMI and Amortization

In term loans:

- EMI includes principal + interest.
- Repayment schedule must be clearly documented.
- Prepayment conditions must be specified.

Incorrect EMI calculation leads to customer disputes.

---

# PART V – FAIR PRACTICES CODE FOR LENDERS

---

## 14. Fair Practices Code (FPC)

Banks must adopt board-approved Fair Practices Code.

It ensures:

- Transparent communication
- Clear loan terms
- Non-discriminatory treatment
- Ethical recovery practices

Loan agreements must clearly mention:

- Interest rate
- Penal charges
- Repayment terms

---

## 15. Guidelines on Recovery Agents

Banks may appoint recovery agents, but:

- Must follow ethical practices.
- Harassment or intimidation prohibited.
- Calls at odd hours not permitted.
- Borrower dignity must be respected.

Banks remain responsible for agent misconduct.

---

# PART VI – OPERATIONAL MANUAL & INTERNAL CONTROLS

---

## 16. Operating Manual for Loans

Banks maintain detailed operating manual covering:

- Sanction authority levels
- Documentation standards
- Monitoring procedures
- Escalation matrix

Non-adherence may result in audit observations.

---

## 17. Internal Audit and Inspection

Loan accounts are subject to:

- Concurrent audit
- Internal inspection
- RBI inspection
- Statutory audit

Operational lapses may attract penalties.

---

## 18. Case-Based Understanding

Case 1:

Loan disbursed without completing mortgage registration.  
Bank’s security becomes weak.

Case 2:

Interest applied wrongly due to incorrect rate update.  
Customer may seek compensation.

Case 3:

Recovery agent threatens borrower publicly.  
Violation of Fair Practices Code.

Case 4:

Interest booked on NPA account without realization.  
Violation of income recognition norms.

---

## 19. Important JAIIB Points

- Interest on NPA cannot be recognized on accrual basis.
- Fair Practices Code must be board-approved.
- Penal charges must be transparent.
- Monitoring prevents slippage to NPA.
- Recovery agents must follow ethical guidelines.
- Documentation must be complete before disbursement.

---

## 20. Conceptual Clarity

Operational management of loan accounts ensures:

- Asset quality
- Regulatory compliance
- Customer protection
- Accurate financial reporting

Sanction is only the beginning.  
Monitoring and operational discipline determine whether a loan remains standard or becomes an NPA.

This block connects lending principles to NPA management and recovery laws.
