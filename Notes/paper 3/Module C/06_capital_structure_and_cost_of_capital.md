# Capital Structure and Cost of Capital

============================================================

## 1. Meaning of Capital Structure

Capital Structure means:

Proportion of debt and equity
Used to finance a firm.

It answers:

How much debt?
How much equity?

============================================================

## 2. Components of Capital Structure

- Equity Share Capital
- Preference Share Capital
- Debentures / Bonds
- Long-term Loans
- Retained Earnings

============================================================

## 3. Leverage (Gearing)

Leverage means:

Use of debt in capital structure.

Higher debt → Higher financial leverage → Higher financial risk.

------------------------------------------------------------

Types of Leverage:

Operating Leverage → Fixed operating cost impact  
Financial Leverage → Fixed interest cost impact  
Combined Leverage → Both combined

============================================================

## 4. Factors Influencing Capital Structure

- Cost of capital
- Risk level
- Tax benefits
- Control considerations
- Market conditions
- Stability of earnings

============================================================

# 5. Theories of Capital Structure

============================================================

## (1) Net Income (NI) Approach

Assumes:

- Cost of debt < Cost of equity
- Increasing debt reduces overall cost of capital
- Firm value increases with more debt

Conclusion:
More debt → Higher firm value.

============================================================

## (2) Net Operating Income (NOI) Approach

Assumes:

- Capital structure does not affect firm value.
- Overall cost of capital remains constant.

Conclusion:
Firm value independent of capital structure.

============================================================

## (3) Traditional Approach

Middle path between NI and NOI.

- Moderate debt increases firm value.
- Excessive debt increases risk and cost.

Conclusion:
There exists optimal capital structure.

============================================================

## 6. Taxation & Capital Structure

Interest on debt is tax deductible.

This creates:

Tax Shield.

Tax Shield = Interest × Tax Rate

Therefore:
Debt financing reduces tax burden.

============================================================

# 7. Cost of Capital

Cost of Capital means:

Minimum return expected by investors.

It is used as:

Discount rate in investment decisions.

============================================================

## 8. Cost of Debt (Kd)

Formula:

Kd = Interest (1 – Tax Rate) / Net Proceeds

After-tax cost is used because interest is tax deductible.

============================================================

## 9. Cost of Preference Shares (Kp)

Kp = Dividend / Net Proceeds

Preference dividend is not tax deductible.

============================================================

## 10. Cost of Equity (Ke)

------------------------------------------------------------

Dividend Growth Model:

Ke = (D1 / P0) + g

Where:

D1 = Expected dividend  
P0 = Market price  
g = Growth rate

------------------------------------------------------------

Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM):

Ke = Rf + β (Rm – Rf)

Rf = Risk-free rate  
Rm = Market return  
β = Beta (systematic risk)

============================================================

# 11. Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)

WACC = (Wd × Kd) + (We × Ke) + (Wp × Kp)

Where:

Wd = Weight of debt  
We = Weight of equity  
Wp = Weight of preference

WACC represents:

Overall cost of capital.

============================================================

## 12. Factors Affecting WACC

- Capital structure mix
- Cost of debt
- Market conditions
- Risk profile
- Tax rate

============================================================

## 13. Weighted Marginal Cost of Capital (WMCC)

Cost of raising one additional unit of capital.

Important for:

Large investment decisions.

============================================================

## 14. Optimal Capital Structure

Optimal structure is where:

WACC is minimum
Firm value is maximum

============================================================

## 15. Floatation Cost

Cost incurred while issuing securities.

Includes:

- Underwriting charges
- Legal fees
- Registration fees

Floatation cost increases cost of capital.

============================================================

## 16. Common Misconceptions

- More debt always better → Wrong (increases risk)
- Cost of equity constant → Not true
- Capital structure irrelevant → Depends on theory

============================================================

## 17. Important Exam Focus Areas

- NI vs NOI approach
- WACC formula
- Cost of debt (after tax)
- Dividend growth model
- Tax shield concept
- Optimal capital structure meaning

============================================================

# Quick Recall

Debt cheaper due to tax shield  
WACC = Weighted average  
Optimal structure → Min WACC  
Ke via DDM or CAPM
