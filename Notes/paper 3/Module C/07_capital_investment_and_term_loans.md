# Capital Investment Decisions / Term Loans

============================================================

## 1. Meaning of Capital Investment Decision

Capital Investment Decision (Capital Budgeting) means:

Decision regarding long-term investments
In projects or assets.

Examples:

- New plant setup
- Machinery purchase
- Expansion project
- Infrastructure development

These decisions involve large funds and long-term impact.

============================================================

## 2. Importance of Capital Budgeting

- Involves large investment
- Long-term commitment
- Difficult to reverse
- Affects profitability and risk

============================================================

# 3. Methods of Investment Appraisal

Two categories:

1. Non-Discounted Cash Flow Methods
2. Discounted Cash Flow Methods

============================================================

# A. Non-Discounted Methods

============================================================

## (1) Payback Period Method

Measures:

Time required to recover initial investment.

Formula:

Payback Period = Initial Investment / Annual Cash Inflow

------------------------------------------------------------

### Example:

Investment = ₹1,00,000  
Annual cash inflow = ₹25,000

Payback Period = 1,00,000 / 25,000  
= 4 years

Shorter payback → Preferred.

Limitation:
Ignores time value of money.

============================================================

## (2) Accounting Rate of Return (ARR)

ARR = Average Profit / Average Investment × 100

Measures accounting profitability.

Limitation:
Based on accounting profit, not cash flow.

============================================================

# B. Discounted Cash Flow Methods

These consider Time Value of Money.

============================================================

## (1) Net Present Value (NPV)

NPV = Present Value of Cash Inflows – Initial Investment

Decision Rule:

NPV > 0 → Accept  
NPV < 0 → Reject

------------------------------------------------------------

### Example:

Investment = ₹1,00,000  
PV of inflows = ₹1,20,000

NPV = 20,000 → Accept

============================================================

## (2) Internal Rate of Return (IRR)

IRR is:

Discount rate at which NPV = 0.

Decision Rule:

IRR > Cost of Capital → Accept  
IRR < Cost of Capital → Reject

============================================================

## (3) Profitability Index (PI)

PI = PV of Inflows / Initial Investment

If PI > 1 → Accept

============================================================

# 4. Comparison of Methods

Payback:
Simple but ignores time value.

NPV:
Most reliable method.

IRR:
Popular but may give multiple values in some cases.

============================================================

# 5. Basic Concepts of Term Loans

Term Loan means:

Loan granted for fixed period
Usually for capital expenditure.

Features:

- Fixed repayment schedule
- Interest payable periodically
- Secured by assets

============================================================

## 6. Deferred Payment Guarantee (DPG)

DPG is:

Guarantee issued by bank
On behalf of customer
For deferred payment purchase of machinery.

Bank assures supplier that payment will be made.

============================================================

## 7. Project Financing

Project financing means:

Loan given based on project viability
Not merely on borrower’s balance sheet.

Focus on:

- Cash flow of project
- Feasibility report
- Risk analysis

============================================================

## 8. Term Loan Appraisal vs Project Appraisal

Term Loan Appraisal:

Focus on borrower’s financial strength.

Project Appraisal:

Focus on project viability
Cash flow
Economic feasibility.

============================================================

## 9. Important Exam Focus Areas

- NPV formula and decision rule
- IRR concept
- Payback formula
- Difference between discounted & non-discounted methods
- Term loan features
- Project appraisal meaning

============================================================

# Quick Recall

NPV > 0 → Accept  
IRR > Cost of Capital → Accept  
Payback = Investment / Annual inflow

Time value of money important
