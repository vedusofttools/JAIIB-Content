# Financial Mathematics – Bonds and Yield to Maturity (YTM)

============================================================

## 1. Meaning of Debt

Debt means:

Borrowed money
That must be repaid with interest.

Companies and governments raise funds through debt instruments.

============================================================

## 2. What is a Bond?

A Bond is:

A fixed income instrument
Representing a loan made by investor to issuer.

Investor = Lender  
Issuer = Borrower

============================================================

## 3. Important Terms in Bonds

------------------------------------------------------------

Face Value (Par Value):
Amount repaid at maturity (usually ₹1,000).

Coupon Rate:
Interest rate paid on face value.

Coupon Payment:
Face Value × Coupon Rate

Maturity:
Date when principal is repaid.

Market Price:
Current trading price of bond.

Yield:
Return earned by investor.

============================================================

## 4. Types of Bonds

- Government Bonds
- Corporate Bonds
- Zero Coupon Bonds
- Callable Bonds
- Convertible Bonds

============================================================

## 5. Bond Valuation (Very Important)

Bond value is:

Present value of future cash flows.

Formula:

Bond Value = PV of Coupons + PV of Face Value

------------------------------------------------------------

If:

C = Annual coupon  
r = Required return  
n = Years to maturity  
F = Face value

Then:

Bond Price = C × [1 – (1+r)^(-n)] / r
+ F / (1+r)^n

============================================================

## 6. Example – Bond Valuation

Face Value = ₹1,000  
Coupon Rate = 10%  
Coupon = ₹100  
Required Return = 8%  
Maturity = 3 years

Calculate:

PV of Coupons  
PV of Face Value

Total = Bond Price

If required return < coupon rate → Bond sells at premium  
If required return > coupon rate → Bond sells at discount

============================================================

## 7. Bond with Semi-Annual Interest

If interest paid twice a year:

- Divide coupon rate by 2
- Multiply periods by 2
- Divide required return by 2

============================================================

## 8. Current Yield

Current Yield = Annual Coupon / Market Price × 100

It measures:

Income return only
(Not total return)

============================================================

## 9. Yield to Maturity (YTM)

YTM is:

Total return earned
If bond held till maturity.

It considers:

- Coupon payments
- Capital gain/loss
- Time value of money

Approximate Formula:

YTM ≈
[Annual Interest + (Face Value – Price)/n]
/
[(Face Value + Price)/2]

============================================================

## 10. Duration of Bond

Duration measures:

Sensitivity of bond price to interest rate changes.

Higher duration → More price volatility.

Zero coupon bond has highest duration.

============================================================

## 11. Bond Price and Interest Rate Relationship

Important Rule:

Interest rate ↑ → Bond price ↓  
Interest rate ↓ → Bond price ↑

Inverse relationship.

============================================================

## 12. Bond Price Volatility

Longer maturity → Higher volatility  
Lower coupon → Higher volatility

============================================================

## 13. Important Theorems for Bond Value

- Bond price equals face value if coupon rate = required return.
- Bond price increases when required return decreases.
- Longer maturity bonds fluctuate more.

============================================================

## 14. Important Exam Focus Areas

- Bond valuation formula
- YTM calculation
- Current yield vs YTM
- Inverse relationship
- Semi-annual adjustment
- Premium vs discount bond

============================================================

# Quick Formula Sheet

Bond Price = PV of coupons + PV of face value

Current Yield = Coupon / Price

Approx YTM formula given above

Interest rate ↑ → Price ↓
