# Financial Mathematics – Interest & Annuities

============================================================

## 1. Simple Interest

Simple Interest (SI) is calculated only on principal amount.

Formula:

SI = (P × R × T) / 100

Where:
P = Principal  
R = Rate of Interest  
T = Time (in years)

Total Amount (A):

A = P + SI

------------------------------------------------------------

### Example:

P = 1,00,000  
R = 10%  
T = 2 years

SI = (1,00,000 × 10 × 2) / 100  
= 20,000

Amount = 1,20,000

============================================================

## 2. Compound Interest

Compound Interest is calculated on:

Principal + accumulated interest.

Formula:

A = P (1 + r)^n

Where:
r = rate in decimal
n = number of periods

Compound Interest = A – P

------------------------------------------------------------

### Example:

P = 1,00,000  
r = 10%  
n = 2 years

A = 1,00,000 (1.1)^2  
= 1,21,000

CI = 21,000

============================================================

## 3. Fixed vs Floating Interest Rates

Fixed Rate:
- Remains constant during loan tenure.

Floating Rate:
- Changes based on benchmark rate (e.g., repo rate).

Floating rate carries interest rate risk.

============================================================

## 4. Front-End and Back-End Interest

Front-End Interest:
Interest collected at beginning.

Back-End Interest:
Interest collected at maturity.

Common in discounting of bills.

============================================================

## 5. Calculation Using Products/Balances

Used in banking for interest on savings/current accounts.

Interest = Sum of Products × Rate / (100 × Days in year)

Product = Balance × Number of days

============================================================

# 6. Annuities

Annuity means:

Equal payments made at regular intervals.

Examples:
- EMI payments
- Pension payments
- Insurance premium

============================================================

## 7. Future Value of Ordinary Annuity

Ordinary Annuity:
Payments made at end of each period.

Formula:

FV = A × [(1 + r)^n – 1] / r

Where:
A = periodic payment  
r = interest rate  
n = number of periods

============================================================

## 8. Present Value of Ordinary Annuity

Formula:

PV = A × [1 – (1 + r)^(-n)] / r

Used to calculate:

- Loan amount
- Present value of EMIs

============================================================

## 9. Annuity Due

Payments made at beginning of each period.

Future Value of Annuity Due:

FV (Annuity Due) = FV (Ordinary Annuity) × (1 + r)

Present Value of Annuity Due:

PV (Annuity Due) = PV (Ordinary Annuity) × (1 + r)

============================================================

## 10. Loan Repayment (EMI Calculation)

EMI Formula:

EMI = P × r (1 + r)^n / [(1 + r)^n – 1]

Where:
P = Loan amount  
r = monthly rate  
n = total number of months

EMI includes:
- Principal
- Interest

============================================================

## 11. Example – EMI

Loan = 1,00,000  
Rate = 12% per annum  
Monthly rate = 1%  
Tenure = 12 months

Use formula:

EMI = 1,00,000 × 0.01 (1.01)^12 / [(1.01)^12 – 1]

Result approx = 8,885 (rounded)

============================================================

## 12. Important Exam Focus Areas

- SI vs CI difference
- Compound interest formula
- Annuity formulas
- EMI formula
- Difference between ordinary annuity and annuity due
- Product method for interest

============================================================

# Quick Formula Sheet

SI = PRT / 100  
A = P (1 + r)^n  
FV (Ordinary Annuity) = A [(1+r)^n – 1] / r  
PV (Ordinary Annuity) = A [1 – (1+r)^-n] / r  
EMI = P r (1+r)^n / [(1+r)^n – 1]
