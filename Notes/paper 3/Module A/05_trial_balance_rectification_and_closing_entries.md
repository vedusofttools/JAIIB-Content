# Trial Balance, Rectification of Errors and Adjusting & Closing Entries

(Teacher Mode – Beginner Friendly + Exam Oriented)

------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. What is a Trial Balance?

After recording transactions in:
- Journal
- Ledger

We prepare a Trial Balance.

Trial Balance is:

A statement that lists all ledger balances
To check whether total debits equal total credits.

It is prepared to test arithmetic accuracy.

------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Why is Trial Balance Prepared?

Purpose:

- Check mathematical accuracy
- Detect errors
- Help prepare financial statements
- Ensure debit = credit

Remember:

If Trial Balance agrees,
It does NOT mean there are no errors.

------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Features of Trial Balance

- Prepared periodically
- Contains all ledger balances
- Debit column total = Credit column total
- It is not a financial statement

------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Types of Trial Balance

### (1) Unadjusted Trial Balance
Prepared before adjustments.

### (2) Adjusted Trial Balance
Prepared after adjustment entries.

### (3) Post-Closing Trial Balance
Prepared after closing entries.

------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. What if Trial Balance Does Not Agree?

If debit total ≠ credit total,

There must be errors.

Possible reasons:

- Wrong addition
- Posting error
- Entry on one side only
- Wrong amount posted

------------------------------------------------------------

# 6. Classification of Errors

Very important for exams.

------------------------------------------------------------

## (A) Errors of Omission

Transaction not recorded at all.

Example:
Purchase not entered.

Effect:
Trial Balance still agrees.

------------------------------------------------------------

## (B) Errors of Commission

Wrong posting or calculation.

Example:
Posted to wrong account.

May or may not affect Trial Balance.

------------------------------------------------------------

## (C) Errors of Principle

Violation of accounting principle.

Example:
Purchase of machinery recorded as expense.

Trial Balance still agrees.

------------------------------------------------------------

## (D) Compensating Errors

Two errors cancel each other.

Example:
Understatement of purchase ₹1,000
Understatement of sales ₹1,000

Trial Balance agrees but accounts are wrong.

------------------------------------------------------------

# 7. Suspense Account

When Trial Balance does not match:

Difference is temporarily placed in Suspense Account.

Later,
When error is found,
Rectification entry is passed
And suspense account is cleared.

------------------------------------------------------------

## Example:

Trial Balance difference: ₹2,000 (Debit side short)

Entry:
Suspense A/c Dr 2,000  
To Trial Balance A/c 2,000

Later, correct the error.

------------------------------------------------------------

# 8. Rectification of Errors

Rectification means correcting mistakes.

There are two situations:

------------------------------------------------------------

## (1) Before Final Accounts

Correction is simple.
Pass rectification journal entry.

------------------------------------------------------------

## (2) After Books Are Closed

Correction affects:
- Profit and Loss Adjustment Account
- Suspense Account

More careful treatment required.

------------------------------------------------------------

# 9. Adjusting Entries

At end of accounting period,
Some entries must be adjusted.

Examples:

- Outstanding expenses
- Prepaid expenses
- Accrued income
- Depreciation
- Provision for doubtful debts

These ensure:
Accrual concept is followed.

------------------------------------------------------------

## Example:

Salary outstanding ₹10,000.

Entry:
Salary A/c Dr 10,000  
To Outstanding Salary A/c 10,000

This increases expense and shows liability.

------------------------------------------------------------

# 10. Closing Entries

At year end:

- Transfer expenses to Profit & Loss A/c
- Transfer income to Profit & Loss A/c
- Transfer profit to Capital A/c

Purpose:
Start next year with fresh income & expense accounts.

------------------------------------------------------------

# 11. Why This Topic is Important in Banking?

Banks must:

- Detect posting errors
- Reconcile daily accounts
- Maintain audit trail
- Ensure accurate financial reporting

Errors can impact:
- Regulatory compliance
- Capital adequacy
- Public confidence

------------------------------------------------------------

# 12. Common Exam Traps

- Thinking trial balance agreement means no error
- Confusing error of principle with error of commission
- Ignoring suspense account logic
- Forgetting adjustment entries affect two accounts

------------------------------------------------------------

# Quick Revision Points

- Trial Balance checks arithmetic accuracy
- Not all errors affect Trial Balance
- Suspense account used temporarily
- Adjustments ensure correct profit
- Closing entries reset income & expense accounts
