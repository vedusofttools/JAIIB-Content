# Capital and Revenue Expenditure

(Teacher Mode – Clear Logic + Examples)

------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. What is Expenditure?

Expenditure means:

Amount spent by a business
For acquiring goods or services.

But not all expenditure is treated the same in accounting.

There are two main types:

1. Capital Expenditure
2. Revenue Expenditure

Understanding the difference is very important.

------------------------------------------------------------

# 2. Capital Expenditure

Capital Expenditure is:

Money spent to acquire or improve a long-term asset
That provides benefit for more than one accounting year.

It creates or increases assets.

------------------------------------------------------------

## Features of Capital Expenditure

- Long-term benefit
- Increases earning capacity
- Creates asset
- Not charged fully to current year profit

------------------------------------------------------------

## Examples

- Purchase of land
- Purchase of machinery
- Building construction
- Installation charges of machinery
- Major renovation increasing capacity

------------------------------------------------------------

## Accounting Treatment

Capital expenditure is:

Shown in Balance Sheet as asset.

Depreciation is charged gradually.

------------------------------------------------------------

### Example:

Machine purchased ₹5,00,000.

Entry:
Machinery A/c Dr 5,00,000  
To Cash A/c 5,00,000

Not treated as expense immediately.

------------------------------------------------------------

# 3. Revenue Expenditure

Revenue Expenditure is:

Money spent for day-to-day operations
And benefits only current accounting year.

It does NOT create asset.

------------------------------------------------------------

## Features of Revenue Expenditure

- Short-term benefit
- Recurring in nature
- Charged fully to Profit & Loss Account
- Does not increase asset value

------------------------------------------------------------

## Examples

- Salary
- Rent
- Electricity
- Repairs (normal)
- Office expenses

------------------------------------------------------------

## Accounting Treatment

Revenue expenditure is:

Debited to Profit & Loss Account.

It reduces current year profit.

------------------------------------------------------------

### Example:

Paid rent ₹20,000.

Entry:
Rent A/c Dr 20,000  
To Cash A/c 20,000

------------------------------------------------------------

# 4. Capital vs Revenue – Key Differences

Capital Expenditure:
- Long-term benefit
- Creates asset
- Shown in Balance Sheet

Revenue Expenditure:
- Short-term benefit
- No asset creation
- Charged to Profit & Loss Account

------------------------------------------------------------

# 5. Special Situations (Very Important for Exams)

------------------------------------------------------------

## (A) Repairs

Normal repairs → Revenue expenditure  
Major overhaul increasing life → Capital expenditure

Example:
Painting office → Revenue  
Replacing entire engine → Capital

------------------------------------------------------------

## (B) Installation Charges

Installation of machinery → Capital  
Routine maintenance → Revenue

------------------------------------------------------------

## (C) Legal Expenses

Legal expense to acquire land → Capital  
Legal expense for routine dispute → Revenue

------------------------------------------------------------

# 6. Revenue Receipts vs Capital Receipts

Not only expenditure, receipts are also classified.

------------------------------------------------------------

## Capital Receipts

- Owner’s capital
- Loan taken
- Sale of asset

Not treated as income.

------------------------------------------------------------

## Revenue Receipts

- Sales
- Commission
- Interest income

These are treated as income.

------------------------------------------------------------

# 7. Importance in Banking

Banks must correctly classify:

- Purchase of software (capital or expense?)
- Major branch renovation
- ATM installation
- Routine maintenance

Wrong classification affects:

- Profit
- Asset value
- Regulatory compliance

------------------------------------------------------------

# 8. Common Beginner Mistakes

- Treating purchase of asset as expense
- Confusing repair with improvement
- Treating loan received as income
- Not distinguishing long-term vs short-term benefit

------------------------------------------------------------

# 9. Quick Test Logic

Ask yourself:

Does it create asset?
Does it give benefit beyond one year?
Does it increase earning capacity?

If YES → Capital

If NO → Revenue

------------------------------------------------------------

# Quick Revision Points

- Capital → Asset → Balance Sheet
- Revenue → Expense → P&L
- Long-term vs Short-term benefit
- Receipts also classified
- Major repair may become capital
