# Accounting Principles and Standards

## 1. What is Accounting?

In the simplest words:

Accounting is the process of:
- Recording financial transactions
- Classifying them
- Summarising them
- Presenting them in reports

So that users can understand the financial position of a business.

Think of accounting as:
👉 The language of business.

Just like language helps us communicate thoughts,
Accounting helps a business communicate its financial story.

## 2. Nature and Purpose of Accounting

### Nature of Accounting

Accounting is:
- Systematic (follows rules)
- Historical (records past transactions)
- Monetary (only records transactions measurable in money)
- Objective (based on evidence)

---

### Purpose of Accounting

Accounting helps to:

1. Know profit or loss
2. Know financial position (assets & liabilities)
3. Help management make decisions
4. Provide information to stakeholders
5. Comply with legal requirements

For banks, accounting is extremely important because:
- Depositors’ money is involved
- Regulators monitor financial health
- Transparency is mandatory

## 3. Historical Perspective of Accounting

Accounting started in ancient civilisations.

- Early traders maintained basic records.
- Double entry system developed in 15th century Italy.
- Luca Pacioli is known as the father of modern accounting.

Over time, accounting evolved from:
Simple record keeping → Structured financial reporting → Global standards.

## 4. New Accounting System / Value System Accounting

Traditional accounting focuses on:
- Historical cost (original purchase value)

Modern accounting increasingly focuses on:
- Fair value
- Present market value
- Real economic worth

This shift improves transparency and reflects real financial position.

Banks especially use fair value for:
- Investments
- Derivatives
- Financial instruments

# 5. Accounting Principles

Accounting follows certain basic rules called Accounting Principles.

These ensure:
- Uniformity
- Comparability
- Reliability

Let us understand important principles clearly.

---

## (a) Business Entity Concept

Business is separate from owner.

Example:
If owner invests ₹5 lakh,
It is business capital,
Not business income.

This ensures clarity in financial records.

---

## (b) Going Concern Concept

It assumes business will continue in future.

So:
- Assets are not valued at liquidation price.
- Depreciation is spread over useful life.

Unless business is closing, this assumption holds.

---

## (c) Historical Cost Concept

Assets are recorded at:
- Purchase price
- Not current market value (traditionally)

Example:
Land bought for ₹10 lakh in 2010.
Even if worth ₹50 lakh today,
It is recorded at ₹10 lakh (unless revalued).

---

## (d) Conservatism (Prudence) Principle

“Anticipate losses, but do not anticipate profits.”

This means:
- Provide for expected losses
- Do not record profit until realised

Example:
If debtor may not pay,
Create provision for doubtful debts.

This principle is very important in banking.

---

## (e) Revenue Recognition Principle

Revenue is recognised when:
- It is earned
- Not when cash is received

Example:
Goods sold on credit → revenue recognised immediately.

---

## (f) Accrual Principle

Income and expenses are recorded:
- When they occur
- Not when cash is paid or received

This gives correct profit for a period.

# 6. Accounting Standards

Accounting standards are:

Formal guidelines issued by authorities
To standardise accounting practices.

Purpose:
- Uniformity
- Transparency
- Comparability

# 7. US GAAP

GAAP stands for:

Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.

US GAAP:
- Used in United States
- Rule-based system
- Detailed and specific guidelines

---

# 8. IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards)

Purpose:

Many countries use IFRS.

---

# 9. Difference Between GAAP and IFRS

GAAP:
- Rule-based
- More detailed guidance
- Less flexibility

IFRS:
- Principle-based
- More judgment-oriented
- Focus on substance over form

Ind AS is closer to IFRS than GAAP.

# 10. Transfer Pricing

Pricing of goods/services between:
