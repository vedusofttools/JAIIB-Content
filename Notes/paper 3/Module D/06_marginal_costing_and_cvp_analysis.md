# Marginal Costing & Cost-Volume-Profit (CVP) Analysis

============================================================

## 1. Meaning of Marginal Costing

Marginal Costing is:

A costing technique
Where only variable costs are charged to product.

Fixed cost is treated as:

Period cost
And written off to Profit & Loss Account.

============================================================

## 2. Key Concept: Contribution

Contribution = Sales – Variable Cost

Contribution is used to:

- Cover fixed cost
- Generate profit

Profit = Contribution – Fixed Cost

============================================================

## 3. Advantages of Marginal Costing

- Simple to understand
- Useful for decision making
- Helps in break-even analysis
- Assists in profit planning

============================================================

## 4. Limitations of Marginal Costing

- Ignores fixed cost in product cost
- Not suitable for external reporting
- Assumes costs are clearly classified

============================================================

# 5. Break-Even Analysis

Break-even point is:

Level of sales
Where total revenue = total cost.

At BEP:

Profit = 0

============================================================

## 6. Break-Even Formula

BEP (in units) = Fixed Cost / Contribution per Unit

Contribution per Unit = Selling Price – Variable Cost

============================================================

## 7. Break-Even in Sales Value

BEP (in ₹) = Fixed Cost / P/V Ratio

============================================================

# 8. P/V Ratio (Profit-Volume Ratio)

P/V Ratio = Contribution / Sales × 100

OR

(Selling Price – Variable Cost) / Selling Price × 100

Higher P/V ratio → Higher profitability.

============================================================

## 9. Margin of Safety (MOS)

Margin of Safety = Actual Sales – Break-even Sales

Indicates:

Safety margin before loss begins.

Higher MOS → Lower risk.

============================================================

# 10. Cost-Volume-Profit (CVP) Analysis

CVP analysis studies:

Relationship between:

- Cost
- Volume
- Profit

Assumptions:

- Selling price constant
- Variable cost per unit constant
- Fixed cost constant
- Production equals sales

============================================================

# 11. Absorption Costing

In Absorption Costing:

Both fixed and variable costs
Are included in product cost.

Used for:

Financial reporting.

============================================================

# 12. Difference: Marginal vs Absorption Costing

Marginal Costing:

- Fixed cost treated as period cost
- Stock valued at variable cost

Absorption Costing:

- Fixed cost included in product cost
- Stock valued at total cost

============================================================

## 13. Income Measurement Difference

When production ≠ sales:

Profit differs under both methods.

If Production > Sales:

Absorption profit > Marginal profit.

If Production < Sales:

Marginal profit > Absorption profit.

============================================================

# 14. Example

Selling Price = ₹100  
Variable Cost = ₹60  
Fixed Cost = ₹2,00,000

Contribution per unit = 40

BEP = 2,00,000 / 40  
= 5,000 units

============================================================

## 15. Important Exam Focus Areas

- Contribution formula
- BEP formula
- P/V ratio
- Margin of safety
- Difference between absorption and marginal costing
- Profit comparison when production ≠ sales

============================================================

# Quick Formula Sheet

Contribution = Sales – Variable Cost  
Profit = Contribution – Fixed Cost  
BEP (Units) = FC / (SP – VC)  
P/V Ratio = Contribution / Sales  
MOS = Actual Sales – BEP Sales
