============================================================

## 8. Cost Centre and Cost Unit

Cost Centre:

Location or person where cost is accumulated.

Example:
Machine department.

Cost Unit:

Unit of product or service
For which cost is measured.

Example:
Per unit, per ton, per kilometer.

============================================================

## 9. Methods and Techniques of Costing

- Job costing
- Batch costing
- Process costing
- Contract costing
- Service costing

Techniques:

- Standard costing
- Marginal costing
- Budgetary control

============================================================

## 10. Cost Accounting Standards

Issued to:

Standardise cost measurement.

Ensure:

Uniformity and comparability.

============================================================

# Management Accounting

============================================================

## 11. Meaning of Management Accounting

============================================================

## 13. Tools of Management Accounting

- Ratio analysis
- Budgeting
- Standard costing

- Cash flow analysis

============================================================

## 14. Relationship Between Different Accounting Systems

------------------------------------------------------------

Financial Accounting:

Records historical transactions.
Prepared for external users.

------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------

Financial Management:

Uses accounting data
For investment and financing decisions.

============================================================

## 15. Important Exam Focus Areas

- Cost classification
- Cost centre vs cost unit
- Fixed vs variable cost
- Cost accounting vs financial accounting
- Objectives of management accounting

============================================================

Quick Recall:

Cost = Resource sacrifice  
Cost Centre = Where cost incurred  
Cost Unit = Unit of output  
Fixed cost does not change with output  
Variable cost changes with output
