## 5. Structure of Profit & Loss Account

Profit & Loss Account shows:

All incomes and expenses of the year.

------------------------------------------------------------

Expenses (Debit Side):

- Salary
- Rent
- Electricity
- Depreciation
- Bad debts
- Office expenses

------------------------------------------------------------

Income (Credit Side):

- Sales
- Commission
- Interest
- Other income

------------------------------------------------------------

If Income > Expenses → Net Profit  
If Expenses > Income → Net Loss

Net Profit transferred to Capital.

============================================================

## 6. Structure of Balance Sheet

Balance Sheet shows:

Assets on one side
Liabilities + Capital on other side

------------------------------------------------------------

Liabilities:

- Capital
- Loan
- Creditors
- Outstanding expenses

------------------------------------------------------------

Assets:

- Cash
- Bank
- Machinery
- Furniture
- Debtors
- Prepaid expenses

============================================================

## 7. Illustration (Simple Example)

Trial Balance shows:

Capital = 2,00,000  
Cash = 50,000  
Furniture = 1,00,000  
Sales = 80,000  
Salary = 20,000  
Rent = 10,000

Adjustment:
Depreciation on furniture = 10,000

------------------------------------------------------------

Step 1: P&L

Income:
Sales = 80,000

Expenses:
Salary = 20,000  
Rent = 10,000  
Depreciation = 10,000

Total Expenses = 40,000

Net Profit = 40,000

------------------------------------------------------------

Step 2: Update Capital

Capital = 2,00,000 + 40,000  
= 2,40,000

------------------------------------------------------------

Step 3: Balance Sheet

Assets:
Cash = 50,000  
Furniture (1,00,000 – 10,000) = 90,000

Total = 1,40,000

Liabilities:
Capital = 2,40,000

============================================================

## 8. Preparation of Financial Statements from Trial Balance

Rules:

- All expenses → P&L Debit
- All incomes → P&L Credit
- All assets → Balance Sheet Asset side
- All liabilities → Balance Sheet Liability side

Adjustments appear:

- In P&L
- In Balance Sheet (as asset or liability)

============================================================

## 9. Importance in Banking

Banks prepare:

- Profit & Loss Account
- Balance Sheet
- Notes to Accounts

Adjustments critical in:

- Interest accrual
- NPA provisioning
- Depreciation
- Provision for bad debts

Incorrect adjustments distort profit.

============================================================

## 10. Common Exam Mistakes

- Forgetting dual effect of adjustments
- Not reducing asset after depreciation
- Posting prepaid expense wrongly
- Confusing accrued and advance income

============================================================

## 11. Quick Revision Points

✔ Trial Balance is base  
✔ Adjustments ensure accuracy  
✔ Profit = Income – Expenses  
✔ Profit increases capital  
✔ Balance Sheet must balance
