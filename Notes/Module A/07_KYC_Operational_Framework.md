MODULE A – GENERAL BANKING OPERATIONS  
JAIIB – Detailed Notes (Legal + Operational + Practical Orientation)

---

## 1. Introduction

Know Your Customer (KYC) is the operational arm of AML compliance.

While PMLA provides the legal foundation, KYC provides the practical mechanism to:

- Identify customers
- Assess risk
- Monitor transactions
- Prevent misuse of banking system

KYC compliance is mandatory under:

- Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002
- Prevention of Money Laundering (Maintenance of Records) Rules, 2005
- RBI Master Direction – Know Your Customer (KYC)

Failure to comply may attract:

- RBI monetary penalties
- Supervisory restrictions
- Regulatory action

## 2. Legal Basis of KYC in India

KYC obligations arise from:

1. Section 12 of PMLA
2. PML Rules, 2005
3. RBI Master Directions on KYC

Section 12 mandates banks to:

- Verify identity of clients.
- Maintain transaction records.
- Identify beneficial owner.
- Furnish information to FIU-IND.

RBI Master Directions operationalize these requirements.

## 3. Components of KYC

KYC framework consists of four key elements:

1. Customer Acceptance Policy (CAP)
2. Customer Identification Procedures (CIP)
3. Monitoring of Transactions
4. Risk Management

Each component must be implemented formally through board-approved policy.

---

## 4. Customer Acceptance Policy (CAP)

CAP ensures that banks do not open accounts for:

- Anonymous persons
- Fictitious names
- Shell entities without purpose
- Customers unwilling to provide required documents

Banks must define:

- Risk categories
- Circumstances requiring enhanced due diligence
- Conditions for refusal of account

Example:

If customer refuses to provide PAN or identity proof, bank must not open account.

---

## 5. Customer Identification Procedure (CIP)

CIP requires verification of:

- Identity
- Address
- PAN
- Photograph
- Beneficial ownership (in case of non-individuals)

Officially Valid Documents (OVDs) include:

- Aadhaar
- Passport
- Voter ID
- Driving License
- NREGA Job Card (with signature of authority)

If address differs from OVD, customer must submit additional declaration.

Banks may use:

- Aadhaar authentication
- Video KYC
- Digital KYC process (as per RBI guidelines)

---

## 6. Beneficial Ownership

In case of non-individual entities, banks must identify natural persons who ultimately control the entity.

Example:

If Company A is owned by Company B, and Company B is owned by Mr. X, then Mr. X is beneficial owner.

Beneficial ownership threshold generally involves specified percentage of shareholding or control.

Failure to identify beneficial owner is violation of KYC rules.

---

## 7. Risk Categorisation of Customers

Banks must classify customers into:

- Low Risk
- Medium Risk
- High Risk

Risk factors include:

- Nature of business
- Geographic location
- Transaction profile
- Ownership structure
- Politically Exposed Person (PEP) status

High-risk customers require:

- Enhanced Due Diligence
- More frequent review
- Senior management approval

---

## 8. Periodic Updation of KYC

KYC is not a one-time exercise.

Periodic updation required:

- Every 2 years for high-risk customers
- Every 8 years for low-risk customers (as per RBI norms)
- As per updated regulatory instructions

If customer does not update KYC:

- Bank may restrict operations after notice.

---

## 9. Wire Transfer Rules

Wire transfers are vulnerable to money laundering and terror financing.

Banks must ensure:

- Originator details are captured.
- Beneficiary details are verified.
- Information accompanies the transfer.
- Suspicious transfers are monitored.

For cross-border transfers:

- Enhanced monitoring required.
- Sanction list screening mandatory.

Anonymous wire transfers are prohibited.

---

## 10. Central KYC Records Registry (CKYCR)

CKYCR is a centralized repository for KYC records.

Process:

- Bank uploads customer KYC data to CKYCR.
- Customer receives KYC Identifier.
- Other institutions can retrieve data using KYC ID.

Purpose:

- Avoid duplication.
- Standardize KYC process.
- Improve transparency.

Banks must upload KYC records within prescribed timelines.

---

## 11. Monitoring of Transactions

Monitoring is continuous process.

Banks must detect:

- Unusual large transactions.
- Frequent cash deposits.
- Structuring to avoid reporting.
- Sudden change in transaction pattern.
- Transactions inconsistent with customer profile.

Monitoring may be:

- Automated through software.
- Manual in small branches.

Suspicious transactions must be reported to FIU-IND.

---

## 12. FATF Identified Jurisdictions

FATF periodically identifies:

- High-risk jurisdictions.
- Jurisdictions under increased monitoring.

Transactions involving such jurisdictions require:

- Enhanced due diligence.
- Senior management approval.
- Continuous monitoring.

---

## 13. Correspondent Banking

Before establishing correspondent banking relationship, bank must:

- Assess AML controls of respondent bank.
- Ensure respondent is not a shell bank.
- Obtain senior management approval.

Shell banks (banks with no physical presence and not affiliated to regulated group) are prohibited.

---

## 14. FATCA and CRS Reporting

FATCA (Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act) relates to US tax compliance.

CRS (Common Reporting Standard) is global tax transparency framework.

Banks must:

- Identify tax residency of customers.
- Report specified accounts to tax authorities.
- Maintain documentation.

Failure may lead to international compliance issues.

---

## 15. Secrecy Obligations

Normally, banks must maintain confidentiality.

However, under PMLA and RBI directions:

- Suspicious transactions must be reported.
- Tipping off customer is prohibited.

Secrecy does not override statutory reporting obligations.

---

## 16. Implications of Non-Compliance

Failure in KYC compliance may lead to:

- RBI monetary penalties.
- Restrictions on branch expansion.
- Enforcement action under PMLA.
- Criminal liability for responsible officers.
- Reputational damage.

Recent years have seen heavy penalties imposed for KYC lapses.

---

## 17. Practical Case-Based Understanding

Case 1:

Customer opens account with valid KYC but suddenly starts receiving multiple foreign inward remittances.  
Bank must review risk category and monitor.

Case 2:

Company structure changes but beneficial owner not updated.  
Bank violates KYC obligation.

Case 3:

Wire transfer without originator details processed.  
Violation of wire transfer rules.

---

## 18. Important JAIIB Legal Points

- Section 12 of PMLA mandates KYC compliance.
- Beneficial ownership identification mandatory.
- Risk-based approach required.
- CKYCR integration compulsory.
- STR filing confidential.
- FATCA/CRS reporting mandatory.
- Shell banks prohibited.

---

## 19. Conceptual Clarity

KYC is not just document collection.

It is a continuous risk assessment process involving:

- Identification
- Verification
- Monitoring
- Reporting

Effective KYC protects:

- The bank
- The financial system
- National security

Strong operational KYC reduces fraud and regulatory exposure significantly.
