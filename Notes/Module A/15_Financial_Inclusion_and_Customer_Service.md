MODULE A – GENERAL BANKING OPERATIONS  
JAIIB – Detailed Notes (Regulatory + Operational + Policy-Oriented)

---

## 1. Introduction

Financial Inclusion and Customer Service are two pillars of modern banking regulation in India.

Financial Inclusion ensures access to banking services for all sections of society.  
Customer Service ensures that such services are delivered fairly, transparently, and efficiently.

Both areas are strongly regulated by RBI and are frequently tested in JAIIB through conceptual and case-based questions.

## 2. Meaning of Financial Inclusion

Providing affordable and appropriate financial services to vulnerable and low-income groups in a fair and transparent manner.

It includes access to:

- Savings accounts
- Credit facilities
- Remittance services
- Insurance
- Pension
- Digital payments

The objective is not merely account opening, but meaningful usage of banking services.

## 3. Objectives of Financial Inclusion

- Promote inclusive economic growth
- Reduce dependency on informal moneylenders
- Ensure direct benefit transfer of subsidies
- Enhance financial stability

RBI promotes financial inclusion through:

- Business Correspondent (BC) model
- Financial Inclusion Plans (FIPs)
- Digital payment infrastructure

Banks are required to submit periodic progress reports to RBI.

BSBDA is a zero-balance savings account designed for inclusion.

Features:

- No minimum balance requirement
- Limited free withdrawals
- ATM/debit card facility
- No charges for basic services

It ensures that even economically weaker sections can access banking.

However, it is not meant for heavy commercial transactions.

Key features:

- Zero balance account

BC functions include:

- Account opening assistance
- Cash deposit and withdrawal
- Remittance services
- Micro-credit facilitation

Banks remain responsible for BC’s actions.

BC model reduces operational cost and increases outreach.

## 8. Use of Technology in Financial Inclusion

Technology enhances financial inclusion through:

- Aadhaar-based e-KYC
- Micro ATMs
- UPI
- Mobile banking

Digital infrastructure reduces cost and increases accessibility.

However, digital literacy is essential to prevent fraud.

Financial literacy means:

Ability to understand financial concepts and make informed decisions.

It includes knowledge of:

RBI and banks conduct financial literacy camps through:
