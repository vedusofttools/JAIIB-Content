---

## 1. Introduction

Opening of accounts is one of the most sensitive operational functions in a bank.  
It creates the banker–customer relationship and determines legal rights, liabilities, and compliance responsibilities.

Improper account opening can lead to:

- Fraud
- Money laundering
- Regulatory penalties
- Civil and criminal liability

This block covers opening of accounts of individual customers only.

---

## 2. Legal and Regulatory Framework

Account opening is governed by:

- Banking Regulation Act, 1949
- RBI Master Directions on KYC
- Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA)
- Customer Due Diligence (CDD) norms
- Internal bank policies

No account can be opened without proper KYC compliance.

## 3. Personal Accounts – Types

For individuals, the following accounts can be opened:

- Savings Account
- Current Account (if required)
- Term Deposit
- Recurring Deposit

Before opening, the bank must verify:

- Identity
- Address
- PAN (or Form 60)
- Risk category

## 4. Customer Due Diligence (CDD) Before Opening

Before opening any individual account, the bank must:

1. Obtain and verify identity proof.
2. Obtain and verify address proof.
3. Obtain PAN or Form 60.
4. Conduct risk assessment.
5. Capture photograph.
6. Obtain specimen signature.

If enhanced risk is identified, enhanced due diligence is required.

Example:

If a person with high cash turnover and unclear source of funds approaches bank, enhanced scrutiny is necessary.

## 5. Basic Savings Bank Deposit Account (BSBDA)

BSBDA is meant for financial inclusion.

Features:

- No minimum balance requirement.
- Limited number of withdrawals.
- ATM card facility allowed.
- Meant for weaker sections.

BSBDA cannot be used for business transactions.

---

## 6. Salary Accounts

Salary accounts are savings accounts opened for employees under employer arrangement.

Features:

- Zero balance facility.
- Linked to salary credit.
- May revert to normal savings account if salary not credited for specified period.

Operational risk:

If salary stops and account remains zero balance, charges may apply depending on bank policy.

## 7. Minor Accounts

A minor is a person below 18 years of age.

Minor accounts can be opened in two ways:

1. Minor represented by natural guardian.
2. Minor above certain age allowed to operate independently (as per bank policy).

Legal Principles:

- Minor is not competent to contract.
- Therefore, overdraft cannot be granted in minor account.
- Bank must ensure no debit balance arises.

Example:

If bank mistakenly allows overdraft in minor’s account, recovery becomes legally difficult.

Upon attaining majority:

- Fresh KYC required.
- Signature updated.
- Confirmation of balance obtained.

## 8. Joint Accounts

Joint accounts may be opened by two or more individuals.

Modes of operation must be clearly recorded:

- Either or Survivor
- Jointly
- Former or Survivor
- Anyone or Survivor

Importance:

Mode of operation determines who can withdraw and what happens on death of one account holder.

Example:

If account is “Either or Survivor” and one dies, survivor can operate and receive funds.

Clear instructions must be obtained at account opening stage.

## 9. Nomination Facility

Nomination facility is mandatory to be offered to customers.

Features:

- Applicable to savings, current, and term deposits.
- Only one nominee per account.
- Nominee acts as trustee for legal heirs.

Important:

Nominee is not ultimate owner unless he is also legal heir.

Example:

If a person nominates his friend but legal heirs exist, nominee holds funds in trust for legal heirs.

---

## 10. Obtaining Photographs

Banks must obtain photograph of individual account holder.

Purpose:

- Identity verification
- Fraud prevention
- Record maintenance

In joint accounts, photographs of all account holders must be obtained.

---

## 11. Specimen Signature and Mandate

Specimen signature is collected for:

- Cheque verification
- Transaction authentication

Mandate allows third person to operate account.

Mandate is different from Power of Attorney.

Mandate is revocable and limited in scope.

---

## 12. Special Precautions in Individual Account Opening

Banks must ensure:

- No fictitious name.
- No benami account.
- Proper risk categorisation.
- Monitoring for unusual transactions.
- Proper documentation storage.

Failure may attract PMLA penalties.

---

## 13. Legal Entity Identifier (Brief Reference)

Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) is generally required for non-individual entities in high-value transactions.

For individuals, LEI is not typically applicable unless specific regulatory requirement arises.

Detailed coverage will be in non-individual block.

---

## 14. Red Flags During Account Opening

- Reluctance to provide PAN.
- Mismatch in identity documents.
- Suspicious source of funds.
- Multiple accounts opened simultaneously.
- Use of intermediaries without clear explanation.

Such cases require enhanced due diligence.

---

## 15. Practical Case-Based Understanding

Case 1:

Minor account allowed to go into overdraft.  
Bank cannot legally enforce repayment easily.

Case 2:

Joint account opened without clear operational instruction.  
Dispute arises after death of one holder.

Case 3:

Account opened without proper KYC.  
Regulatory penalty under PMLA possible.

---

## 16. Important JAIIB Points

- Minor cannot enter into valid contract.
- Nominee is trustee, not absolute owner.
- Mode of operation in joint account is crucial.
- PAN or Form 60 mandatory.
- KYC compliance compulsory before activation.

---

## 17. Conceptual Clarity

Opening of account is not a mechanical form-filling process.

It establishes:

- Legal relationship
- Risk profile
- AML responsibility
- Future operational authority

If account opening is correct, most future operational risks reduce significantly.
