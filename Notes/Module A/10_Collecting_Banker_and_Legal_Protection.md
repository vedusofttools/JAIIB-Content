Collecting Banker & Legal Protection

MODULE A – GENERAL BANKING OPERATIONS  
JAIIB – Detailed Notes (Legal + Conceptual + Case-Based Approach)

---

## 1. Introduction

A Collecting Banker is the bank that receives a cheque from its customer and collects payment from the paying (drawee) bank.

Unlike the paying banker, the collecting banker does not directly debit customer’s account. Instead, it acts as an intermediary in the collection process.

The legal responsibilities and protections of a collecting banker are governed primarily by:

- Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881
- Judicial precedents
- RBI operational guidelines

The most important concept in this chapter is **statutory protection under Section 131 of the Negotiable Instruments Act**.

## 2. Meaning of Collecting Banker

A collecting banker is a bank that:

- Receives a cheque from a customer.
- Sends it for collection.
- Credits customer’s account after realization (or sometimes before realization, subject to risk).

The collecting banker acts as an agent of the customer.

Thus, the relationship between collecting banker and customer is that of **agent and principal**.

---

## 3. Statutory Protection – Section 131

Section 131 of the Negotiable Instruments Act provides protection to a collecting banker.

It states that:

A banker who, in good faith and without negligence, receives payment for a customer of a cheque crossed generally or specially to himself shall not incur liability to the true owner by reason only of having received such payment.

This is extremely important.

Without this protection, banks could be sued whenever a cheque collected turned out to be stolen or fraudulently obtained.

---

## 4. Conditions for Protection under Section 131

For the bank to claim protection, the following conditions must be satisfied:

1. The cheque must be crossed.
2. The banker must act in good faith.
3. The banker must act without negligence.
4. The banker must collect for a customer.
5. The banker must receive payment.

If any of these conditions are not satisfied, protection may be denied.

## 5. Meaning of “Good Faith”

Under the General Clauses Act, good faith means:

An act done honestly, whether negligently or not.

However, for protection under Section 131, absence of negligence is separately required.

So honesty alone is not sufficient.

---

## 6. Meaning of “Without Negligence”

This is the most critical condition.

Negligence refers to failure to take reasonable care expected from a prudent banker.

Examples of negligence:

- Opening account without proper KYC.
- Collecting cheque for a person who is not a customer.
- Ignoring suspicious endorsements.
- Failing to verify irregular instruments.

If negligence is proved, statutory protection is lost.

---

## 7. Cheque Must Be Crossed

Protection applies only to crossed cheques.

Types of crossing:

- General crossing (two parallel lines)
- Special crossing (name of specific bank)
- Account Payee crossing

If cheque is uncrossed and bank collects it, protection under Section 131 does not apply.

---

## 8. Collecting for a Customer

Bank must collect cheque for its own customer.

If bank collects cheque for non-customer, it cannot claim protection.

Example:

If a stranger walks into bank and asks bank to collect cheque without holding account, protection is not available.

---

## 9. Collecting Banker as Holder for Value

If bank credits customer’s account before actual realization and allows withdrawal, it becomes “holder for value”.

This increases risk.

If cheque turns out to be defective, bank may suffer loss.

Hence banks often credit proceeds only after realization.

---

## 10. Endorsement of Cheques

Endorsement means signing on back of cheque to transfer ownership.

Types of endorsement:

- Blank endorsement
- Special endorsement
- Restrictive endorsement

Collecting banker must verify:

- Proper chain of endorsements.
- No break in endorsement.
- No suspicious alteration.

Failure to check endorsements may amount to negligence.

---

## 11. Crossing of Cheques

Crossing restricts payment of cheque through banking channel.

General Crossing:

Two parallel lines — cheque must be paid through bank.

Special Crossing:

Name of specific bank written — cheque must be collected through that bank.

Account Payee Crossing:

Indicates amount should be credited only to payee’s account.

Collecting banker must respect crossing instructions strictly.

---

## 12. Forged Instruments

If cheque contains forged endorsement:

- Collecting banker may lose protection if negligent.
- Paying banker may also face liability depending on circumstances.

Example:

If bank collects cheque payable to “Mr. A” but deposits into unrelated account without verifying endorsement, it may be liable.

---

## 13. Duties of Collecting Banker

A collecting banker must:

- Verify KYC at account opening.
- Check proper endorsement.
- Observe crossing instructions.
- Detect suspicious circumstances.
- Avoid negligence.
- Follow internal control procedures.

Failure to perform these duties may result in loss of statutory protection.

---

## 14. Difference Between Paying and Collecting Banker Liability

Paying banker is liable mainly for:

- Wrongful dishonor.
- Payment of forged cheque.

Collecting banker is liable mainly for:

- Conversion (wrongful interference with true owner’s rights).
- Negligent collection.

Statutory protection applies to both, but conditions differ.

---

## 15. Case-Based Understanding

Case 1:

Cheque stolen and deposited into newly opened account without proper KYC.  
Bank may lose protection due to negligence in account opening.

Case 2:

Cheque crossed “Account Payee” credited to wrong account.  
Collecting banker likely negligent.

Case 3:

Cheque endorsed properly and collected in good faith.  
Protection likely available.

Case 4:

Uncrossed cheque collected.  
Protection under Section 131 not available.

## 16. Important JAIIB Legal Points

- Section 131 provides statutory protection.
- Protection available only for crossed cheques.
- Bank must act in good faith and without negligence.
- Collection must be for a customer.
- Proper endorsement verification required.
- Negligence removes protection.
- Account Payee crossing must be strictly followed.

---

## 17. Conceptual Clarity

The collecting banker’s main legal risk is negligence.

If bank:

- Opens account carelessly,
- Ignores suspicious circumstances,
- Fails to verify endorsements,

it may be held liable to true owner of cheque.

Statutory protection is not automatic — it is conditional.

Understanding these principles helps in solving case-based JAIIB questions where facts determine liability.
