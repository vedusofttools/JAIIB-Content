# Inflation: Types, Measurement (CPI, WPI) and Control

## Introduction
Inflation refers to a **sustained rise in the general price level** of goods and services over a period of time, resulting in a **fall in purchasing power of money**.

Inflation is not about a one-time price rise of a single good; it is a **general and continuous increase in prices**.

For banking and policy exams, inflation is important because it directly affects:
- Interest rates
- Credit demand
- Monetary policy
- Savings and investment
- Real income

---

## Meaning of Inflation
Inflation occurs when:
- More money chases the same quantity of goods, or
- Cost of production rises across the economy, or
- Demand rises faster than supply

In simple terms:
> Inflation means **money buys less than before**.

---

## Inflation vs Price Rise
- Inflation → general and persistent increase in prices
- Price rise → increase in price of a single commodity

All inflation involves price rise, but **not all price rises are inflation**.

---

## Types of Inflation (Based on Cause)

## Demand-Pull Inflation
Demand-pull inflation occurs when **aggregate demand exceeds aggregate supply**.

Typical situations:
- Increase in income
- Government deficit spending
- Easy credit
- Population growth

Result:
- Excess demand pushes prices upward

---

## Cost-Push Inflation
Cost-push inflation arises due to **increase in cost of production**, leading producers to raise prices.

Major cost factors:
- Wages
- Raw materials
- Fuel and power
- Taxes

Example:
- Rise in crude oil prices increasing transport and manufacturing costs

---

## Built-In Inflation
Built-in inflation is related to **wage–price spiral**.

Process:
- Workers demand higher wages
- Firms raise prices to cover higher wages
- Workers again demand higher wages

This creates a **self-sustaining inflation cycle**.

## Types of Inflation (Based on Speed)

## Creeping Inflation
- Very slow and gradual
- Usually below 3%
- Considered manageable and sometimes desirable

---

## Walking Inflation
- Moderate inflation
- Prices rise steadily
- Requires monitoring

---

## Running Inflation
- Rapid increase in prices
- Causes economic instability

---

## Hyperinflation
- Extremely high and uncontrollable inflation
- Currency loses value rapidly
- Rare but disastrous

---

## Measurement of Inflation
Inflation is measured using **price indices** that track changes in prices over time.

In India, the two main indices are:
- Consumer Price Index (CPI)
- Wholesale Price Index (WPI)

---

## Consumer Price Index (CPI)

## Meaning
CPI measures changes in prices of **goods and services consumed by households**.

It reflects **cost of living**.

---

## CPI in India
- CPI is the **official measure of inflation** in India
- Used for monetary policy decisions
- Base year: **2012 = 100**

---

## Coverage of CPI
CPI includes:
- Food
- Housing
- Clothing and footwear
- Fuel and light
- Health
- Education
- Transport and communication

---

## Importance of CPI
- Used by central bank for inflation targeting
- Affects wage negotiations and pensions
- Reflects household inflation experience

---

## Wholesale Price Index (WPI)

## Meaning
WPI measures changes in prices of goods at the **wholesale level**.

It tracks price movement before goods reach consumers.

---

## WPI in India
- Used mainly for policy analysis and research
- Does not include services
- Base year: **2011–12 = 100**

---

## Coverage of WPI
WPI includes:
- Primary articles
- Fuel and power
- Manufactured products

---

## Difference Between CPI and WPI
- CPI reflects consumer prices
- WPI reflects wholesale prices
- CPI includes services; WPI does not
- CPI is used for inflation targeting

---

## Inflation Targeting in India
India follows **flexible inflation targeting**.

Key facts:
- Target inflation: **4%**
- Tolerance band: **±2%**
- Range: **2% to 6%**
- Framework adopted in **2016**

CPI is used for this purpose.

## Effects of Inflation

## On Consumers
- Reduces purchasing power
- Hurts fixed income earners
- Increases cost of living

---

## On Producers
- May benefit producers in short run
- Creates uncertainty in long run

---

## On Savers and Investors
- Reduces real returns on savings
- Encourages investment in real assets

---

## On Economy
- Moderate inflation supports growth
- High inflation creates instability

---

## Control of Inflation

Inflation is controlled using **monetary policy** and **fiscal policy**.

---

## Monetary Policy Measures
Used by the central bank.

Main tools:
- Policy interest rates
- Liquidity management
- Credit control

Tight monetary policy reduces money supply and demand.

---

## Fiscal Policy Measures
Used by the government.

Main tools:
- Reduction in public spending
- Increase in taxes
- Reduction in fiscal deficit
- Rationalisation of subsidies

---

## Supply-Side Measures
- Increase production
- Improve supply chains
- Reduce import bottlenecks
- Release buffer stocks

---

## Inflation and Banking
- Inflation affects interest rates
- Influences loan demand
- Impacts asset quality
- Affects real value of deposits
- Central to monetary policy decisions

---

## Common Exam Traps
- Treating CPI and WPI as same
- Assuming WPI includes services
- Confusing price rise with inflation
- Ignoring tolerance band in inflation targeting
