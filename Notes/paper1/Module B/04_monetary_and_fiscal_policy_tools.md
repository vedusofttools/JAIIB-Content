# Monetary and Fiscal Policy Tools

## Introduction
Monetary policy and fiscal policy are the **two main macroeconomic tools** used by authorities to regulate economic activity, control inflation, support growth, and maintain stability.

While both aim at economic stability, they differ in:
- Authority
- Instruments
- Speed of impact
- Area of influence

Understanding their tools is crucial for banking, inflation control, and growth analysis.

## Monetary Policy

## Meaning
Monetary policy refers to the **policy of regulating money supply and credit conditions** in the economy.

It is used to:
- Control inflation
- Support economic growth
- Manage liquidity
- Ensure financial stability

---

## Authority of Monetary Policy
In India, monetary policy is formulated and implemented by the **central bank**.

The policy framework follows **inflation targeting**, using CPI as the reference.

---

## Types of Monetary Policy

## Expansionary Monetary Policy
Used during:
- Economic slowdown
- Recession
- Low demand

Aim:
- Increase money supply
- Encourage borrowing and investment

---

## Contractionary Monetary Policy
Used during:
- High inflation
- Overheating economy

Aim:
- Reduce money supply
- Discourage excessive borrowing

---

## Monetary Policy Tools

## Policy Interest Rates

### Repo Rate
- Rate at which central bank lends to banks
- Increase in repo rate → loans become costlier
- Decrease in repo rate → credit becomes cheaper

Repo rate directly influences:
- Lending rates
- Deposit rates
- Investment decisions

---

### Reverse Repo Rate
- Rate at which banks lend surplus funds to central bank
- Higher reverse repo → banks park more funds
- Lower reverse repo → banks lend more to public

---

## Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF)
LAF allows banks to:
- Borrow funds (repo)
- Park excess funds (reverse repo)

Used for **short-term liquidity management**.

---

## Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR)
- Portion of bank deposits kept as cash with central bank
- Banks earn **no interest** on CRR balance

Impact:
- Increase in CRR → less lendable funds
- Decrease in CRR → more credit creation

---

## Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR)
- Portion of deposits invested in approved securities
- Mostly government securities

Impact:
- Higher SLR → lower lending capacity
- Lower SLR → higher credit availability

---

## Open Market Operations (OMO)
- Central bank buys or sells government securities

Impact:
- Purchase → injects liquidity
- Sale → absorbs liquidity

Used for **long-term liquidity management**.

---

## Marginal Standing Facility (MSF)
- Emergency borrowing facility for banks
- Rate is higher than repo rate

Used when banks face **severe liquidity stress**.

---

## Selective Credit Controls
Used to regulate **credit to specific sectors**.

Examples:
- Margin requirements
- Credit ceilings
- Sectoral exposure norms

---

## Transmission of Monetary Policy
Monetary policy affects the economy through:
- Interest rate channel
- Credit channel
- Expectations channel
- Asset price channel

Transmission is **not always immediate**.

---

## Fiscal Policy

## Meaning
Fiscal policy refers to the **use of government revenue and expenditure** to influence economic activity.

It includes:
- Taxation
- Government spending
- Public borrowing
- Budgetary policy

---

## Authority of Fiscal Policy
Fiscal policy is formulated and implemented by the **government** through the annual budget.

---

## Types of Fiscal Policy

## Expansionary Fiscal Policy
Used during:
- Recession
- Low growth

Measures:
- Increase government spending
- Reduce taxes

---

## Contractionary Fiscal Policy
Used during:
- High inflation
- Large fiscal deficit

Measures:
- Reduce spending
- Increase taxes

---

## Fiscal Policy Tools

## Government Expenditure
- Capital expenditure (infrastructure, investment)
- Revenue expenditure (salaries, subsidies)

Impact:
- Capital expenditure boosts long-term growth
- Revenue expenditure supports short-term demand

---

## Taxation
- Direct taxes (income tax, corporate tax)
- Indirect taxes (GST, excise)

Impact:
- Higher taxes reduce disposable income
- Lower taxes encourage consumption and investment

---

## Public Borrowing
- Government borrows from:
    - Market
    - Banks
    - Public

Excessive borrowing may:
- Increase interest rates
- Crowd out private investment

---

## Fiscal Deficit
Fiscal deficit = Total expenditure – Total receipts (excluding borrowings)

High fiscal deficit:
- Fuels inflation
- Increases debt burden
- Limits policy flexibility

---

## Monetary Policy vs Fiscal Policy

## Key Differences
- Monetary policy controls money and credit
- Fiscal policy controls taxes and spending
- Monetary policy is quicker to implement
- Fiscal policy has stronger long-term impact
- Monetary policy targets inflation
- Fiscal policy targets growth and welfare

---

## Coordination Between Monetary and Fiscal Policy
Effective economic management requires:
- Policy coordination
- Avoiding conflicting signals
- Balancing growth and inflation

Lack of coordination can reduce policy effectiveness.

## Role of Monetary and Fiscal Policy in Banking
- Influences interest rates
- Affects credit growth
- Impacts deposit mobilisation
- Shapes asset quality
- Determines liquidity conditions

---

## Limitations of Monetary Policy
- Weak transmission
- Time lag
- Liquidity traps
- Credit risk aversion

---

## Limitations of Fiscal Policy
- Implementation delays
- Political constraints
- Rising public debt
- Fiscal deficit pressure

---

## Common Exam Traps
- Confusing CRR with SLR
- Assuming fiscal policy is controlled by central bank
- Treating repo and reverse repo as same
- Ignoring role of fiscal deficit
