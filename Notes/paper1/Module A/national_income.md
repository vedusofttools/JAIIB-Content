# National Income – Concepts and Numerical Problems

## Introduction
National Income represents the **total value of goods and services produced** by a country during a given period (usually one year).

It is used to:
- Measure economic growth
- Compare living standards
- Formulate economic policies
- Assess development level

---

## Basic Concepts of National Income

## Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
GDP is the **total market value of all final goods and services produced within the domestic territory** of a country during a year.

### Key Points
- Includes only final goods
- Includes production within country
- Includes depreciation
- Excludes transfer payments

---

## Gross National Product (GNP)
GNP = GDP + Net Factor Income from Abroad (NFIA)

NFIA =
- Income earned by residents from abroad
- Minus income earned by foreigners within the country

---

## Net Domestic Product (NDP)
NDP = GDP – Depreciation

Depreciation = wear and tear of capital goods

---

## Net National Product (NNP)
NNP = GNP – Depreciation

NNP at factor cost is commonly called **National Income**.

---

## National Income (NI)
National Income is the **sum of all factor incomes** earned by normal residents of a country during a year.

### Includes
- Wages
- Rent
- Interest
- Profits

---

## Personal Income (PI)
Personal Income is the **total income received by individuals**, whether earned or not.

PI includes:
- Transfer payments
- Pensions
- Scholarships

---

## Disposable Income (DI)
Disposable Income is the income **available for spending and saving**.

DI = Personal Income – Direct Taxes

---

## Nominal Income
Income measured at **current prices**.

---

## Real Income
Income measured at **constant prices** (adjusted for inflation).

---

## Per Capita Income (PCI)
PCI = National Income ÷ Population

Used as an indicator of **standard of living**.

---

## Methods of Measuring National Income

## 1. Production (Value Added) Method
Measures national income by summing **value added at each stage of production**.

Value Added = Value of Output – Value of Intermediate Goods

---

## 2. Income Method
Measures national income by summing **factor incomes**.

### Components
- Compensation of employees
- Rent
- Interest
- Profits
- Mixed income of self-employed

---

## 3. Expenditure Method
Measures national income by summing **final expenditures**.

GDP =  
Consumption (C)
+ Investment (I)
+ Government Expenditure (G)
+ Net Exports (X – M)

---

## Items Included in National Income
- Wages and salaries
- Rent from land and buildings
- Interest on capital
- Profits of firms
- Mixed income

---

## Items Excluded from National Income
- Transfer payments (pension, scholarships)
- Sale of second-hand goods
- Capital gains
- Illegal activities
- Unpaid household services

---

# NUMERICAL PROBLEMS WITH SOLUTIONS

---

## Numerical 1: GDP Calculation (Expenditure Method)

### Given
- Consumption (C) = ₹500 crore
- Investment (I) = ₹200 crore
- Government Expenditure (G) = ₹300 crore
- Exports (X) = ₹150 crore
- Imports (M) = ₹100 crore

### Formula
GDP = C + I + G + (X – M)

### Solution
GDP = 500 + 200 + 300 + (150 – 100)  
GDP = 500 + 200 + 300 + 50  
GDP = **₹1,050 crore**

---

## Numerical 2: GNP Calculation

### Given
- GDP = ₹1,050 crore
- Income from abroad = ₹40 crore
- Income paid to foreigners = ₹60 crore

### Step 1: Calculate NFIA
NFIA = 40 – 60 = **–₹20 crore**

### Step 2: Calculate GNP
GNP = GDP + NFIA  
GNP = 1,050 – 20  
GNP = **₹1,030 crore**

---

## Numerical 3: NDP and NNP

### Given
- GDP = ₹1,050 crore
- GNP = ₹1,030 crore
- Depreciation = ₹100 crore

### NDP
NDP = GDP – Depreciation  
NDP = 1,050 – 100  
NDP = **₹950 crore**

### NNP
NNP = GNP – Depreciation  
NNP = 1,030 – 100  
NNP = **₹930 crore**

---

## Numerical 4: National Income from Factor Cost

### Given
- NNP at market price = ₹930 crore
- Indirect taxes = ₹80 crore
- Subsidies = ₹30 crore

### Formula
National Income = NNP (MP) – Indirect Taxes + Subsidies

### Solution
NI = 930 – 80 + 30  
NI = **₹880 crore**

---

## Numerical 5: Personal Income

### Given
- National Income = ₹880 crore
- Corporate tax = ₹70 crore
- Undistributed profits = ₹50 crore
- Transfer payments = ₹40 crore

### Formula
PI = NI – Corporate Tax – Undistributed Profits + Transfer Payments

### Solution
PI = 880 – 70 – 50 + 40  
PI = **₹800 crore**

---

## Numerical 6: Disposable Income

### Given
- Personal Income = ₹800 crore
- Direct taxes = ₹120 crore

### Formula
Disposable Income = PI – Direct Taxes

### Solution
DI = 800 – 120  
DI = **₹680 crore**

---

## Numerical 7: Per Capita Income

### Given
- National Income = ₹880 crore
- Population = 44 crore

### Formula
PCI = National Income ÷ Population

### Solution
PCI = 880 ÷ 44  
PCI = **₹20**

---

## Numerical 8: Real Income

### Given
- Nominal Income = ₹1,200
- Price Index = 150

### Formula
Real Income = (Nominal Income ÷ Price Index) × 100

### Solution
Real Income = (1,200 ÷ 150) × 100  
Real Income = **₹800**
