# Economic Reforms in India (LPG – 1991 onwards)

## Introduction
Economic reforms refer to a set of structural changes introduced by the Government of India in 1991 to overcome a severe economic crisis and to make the Indian economy more efficient, competitive, and globally integrated.

These reforms are popularly known as **LPG reforms**, which stand for:
- Liberalisation
- Privatisation
- Globalisation

The reforms marked a shift from a **controlled, inward-looking economy** to a **market-oriented, open economy**.

## Background of Economic Reforms

Before 1991, the Indian economy was characterised by:
- Licence Raj (government permission for almost everything)
- Dominance of public sector
- High import tariffs and trade restrictions
- Low foreign exchange reserves
- Inefficient industries and low growth rate

### Balance of Payments Crisis (1991)
India faced a serious foreign exchange crisis in 1991:
- Forex reserves were sufficient for barely **2–3 weeks of imports**
- High fiscal deficit
- Rising inflation
- Increasing external debt

To tackle this crisis, India approached the **IMF and World Bank**, which suggested structural reforms as a condition for financial assistance.

Liberalisation refers to the **removal or relaxation of government controls and restrictions** on economic activities.

### Objectives of Liberalisation
- Increase efficiency and productivity
- Promote competition
- Encourage private participation

### Major Liberalisation Measures
- Abolition of industrial licensing (except few strategic sectors)
- Freedom to expand and produce
- Reduction in import tariffs and duties

## Privatisation
Privatisation means **reducing the role of the public sector and increasing the participation of the private sector** in economic activities.

It does not always mean complete sale of public enterprises; it may involve partial disinvestment.

Disinvestment in public sector enterprises like BALCO and VSNL helped improve efficiency and brought revenue to the government.
