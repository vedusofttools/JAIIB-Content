# IS–LM Model – Complete Academic Notes

============================================================

## 1. Introduction

The IS–LM Model is a macroeconomic framework that explains how equilibrium is simultaneously achieved in:

- The Goods Market
- The Money Market

It was developed by Sir John Hicks (1937) based on Keynes’ General Theory (1936).

The model determines:

- Equilibrium level of National Income (Y)
- Equilibrium Interest Rate (r)

It combines:

- IS → Investment–Saving equilibrium
- LM → Liquidity Preference–Money Supply equilibrium

# PART I – IS CURVE (GOODS MARKET)

============================================================

## 2. Goods Market Equilibrium

In a closed economy:

Y = C + I + G

Where:

Y = National Income  
C = Consumption  
I = Investment  
G = Government Expenditure

Goods market equilibrium occurs when:

Aggregate Demand = Aggregate Output

============================================================

## 3. Behaviour of Investment

Investment is negatively related to interest rate.

When interest rate decreases:

- Cost of borrowing falls
- Investment increases
- Aggregate demand increases
- Income increases

Thus:

Lower r → Higher I → Higher Y

============================================================

## 4. Why IS Curve Slopes Downward

Interest rate and income move in opposite directions in goods market equilibrium.

If interest rate rises:

- Investment falls
- Aggregate demand falls
- Income falls

Therefore:

Higher r → Lower Y

This inverse relationship makes the IS curve downward sloping.

============================================================

## 5. Mathematical Representation of IS Curve

Investment function:

I = I₀ − b r

Substituting into income equation:

Y = C + I₀ − b r + G

This shows:

Income is negatively related to interest rate.

============================================================

## 6. Shifts in IS Curve

IS shifts right when:

- Government spending increases
- Taxes decrease
- Autonomous investment increases
- Consumer confidence improves

IS shifts left when:

- Government spending decreases
- Taxes increase
- Investment falls

============================================================

# PART II – LM CURVE (MONEY MARKET)

============================================================

## 7. Money Market Equilibrium

Money supply is fixed by central bank:

M = M̄

Money demand consists of:

- Transaction demand (depends on income)
- Speculative demand (depends on interest rate)

Money demand function:

M_d = kY − h r

Equilibrium condition:

M_d = M_s

============================================================

## 8. Why LM Curve Slopes Upward

When income increases:

- Transaction demand for money increases
- Given fixed money supply
- Interest rate must rise to reduce speculative demand

Thus:

Higher Y → Higher r

This direct relationship causes LM curve to slope upward.

============================================================

## 9. Mathematical Representation of LM Curve

M = kY − h r

Rearranging:

r = (k/h)Y − (M/h)

This shows:

Interest rate increases with income.

============================================================

## 10. Shifts in LM Curve

LM shifts right when:

- Money supply increases
- Central bank adopts expansionary monetary policy

LM shifts left when:

- Money supply decreases
- Contractionary monetary policy

============================================================

# PART III – IS–LM EQUILIBRIUM

============================================================

## 11. Simultaneous Equilibrium

Equilibrium occurs where:

IS curve intersects LM curve.

At that point:

- Goods market clears
- Money market clears

We obtain:

- Equilibrium Income (Y*)
- Equilibrium Interest Rate (r*)

============================================================

# PART IV – POLICY ANALYSIS

============================================================

## 12. Expansionary Fiscal Policy

Government increases spending.

Effect:

IS shifts right.

Results:

- Higher income
- Higher interest rate

However:

Higher interest rate reduces private investment.

This is called:

Crowding-Out Effect.

============================================================

## 13. Expansionary Monetary Policy

Central bank increases money supply.

Effect:

LM shifts right.

Results:

- Lower interest rate
- Higher income

Monetary policy stimulates investment.

============================================================

# PART V – SPECIAL CASES

============================================================

## 14. Liquidity Trap

At very low interest rates:

- People prefer holding money
- Speculative demand becomes highly elastic

LM becomes horizontal.

Monetary policy becomes ineffective.

============================================================

## 15. Classical Case

Money demand is insensitive to interest rate.

LM becomes vertical.

Fiscal policy becomes ineffective.

============================================================

# PART VI – EFFECTIVENESS OF POLICIES

============================================================

Fiscal policy is more effective when:

LM curve is relatively flat.

Monetary policy is more effective when:

IS curve is relatively flat.

============================================================

# PART VII – ASSUMPTIONS

============================================================

- Closed economy
- Price level constant
- Short-run analysis
- Fixed money supply
- Investment depends on interest rate

============================================================

# PART VIII – LIMITATIONS

============================================================

- Ignores inflation
- Assumes fixed price level
- Not suitable for long run
- Closed economy assumption unrealistic
- Simplified behavioural assumptions

============================================================

# CONCLUSION

The IS–LM Model explains:

- Interaction between real and monetary sectors
- Determination of income and interest rate
- Impact of fiscal and monetary policies

It remains a foundational tool in macroeconomic analysis.
