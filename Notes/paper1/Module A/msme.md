# MSME

## 1. Definition of MSME
The classification of Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises is governed by the MSMED Act, 2006. As of the latest 2025-26 updates, the distinction between Manufacturing and Service sectors has been removed, and a "Composite Criteria" of Investment and Annual Turnover is used.

- Micro Enterprise: Investment in Plant and Machinery or Equipment does not exceed 2.5 Crore Rupees and Annual Turnover does not exceed 10 Crore Rupees.
- Small Enterprise: Investment does not exceed 25 Crore Rupees and Annual Turnover does not exceed 100 Crore Rupees.
- Medium Enterprise: Investment does not exceed 125 Crore Rupees and Annual Turnover does not exceed 500 Crore Rupees.

Important Note for JAIIB: Export turnover is excluded when calculating the turnover limit for MSME classification to encourage international trade.

## 2. Role and Significance in Economic Development
MSMEs play a vital role in the socio-economic development of India:

- Employment Generation: MSMEs are the second-largest employer in India after Agriculture. They provide jobs to over 340 million people across the country.
- Balanced Regional Development: By setting up units in rural and semi-urban areas, MSMEs help prevent the over-concentration of industries in big cities and reduce regional income disparities.
- Promotion of Entrepreneurship: They provide an opportunity for individuals with limited capital to start their own businesses, fostering innovation and self-reliance.
- Support to Large Industries: They act as ancillary units by supplying components, parts, and raw materials to large-scale industries like Automobiles, Railways, and Defense.
- Low Capital Requirement: MSMEs require less capital compared to large industries to start operations, making them ideal for a developing economy like India.

## 3. Contribution of MSME to the Economy
As per the latest Economic Survey (2025-26) and Ministry data, the MSME sector’s contribution is massive:

- Contribution to GDP: MSMEs contribute approximately 31.1% to India's total Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
- Contribution to Manufacturing: They account for nearly 36% of the total manufacturing output of the country.
- Contribution to Exports: Nearly 48.6% of India's total exports are contributed by the MSME sector.
- Formalization: Through the Udyam Portal, millions of units have been brought into the formal banking system, making it easier for them to access Priority Sector Lending (PSL).

## 4. Banking Perspective (Quick Revision)
- Priority Sector Lending (PSL): Loans to Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises are classified under Priority Sector. Banks have a specific sub-target of 7.5% for Micro Enterprises.
