# Structure of Indian Economy (Sectors & GDP Composition)

## Introduction
The structure of the Indian economy refers to the **composition and contribution of different sectors** to national income (GDP) and employment.

India is a **mixed economy**, where both **public and private sectors** coexist, and economic activities are broadly classified into three main sectors:
- Primary Sector
- Secondary Sector
- Tertiary Sector

Understanding this structure is important for bankers as it explains **credit flow, employment patterns, GDP trends, and policy focus**.

## Contribution to GDP
In India:
- Tertiary sector contributes the **largest share to GDP**
- Secondary sector shows steady growth
- Primary sector contributes the **least to GDP** but employs the **maximum workforce**

### Key Insight
There is a **structural imbalance** where:
- Agriculture employs many people
- Services generate most income

---

## Employment Pattern in Indian Economy

- Primary sector employs the largest share of population
- Secondary sector employs fewer people but adds more value
- Tertiary sector employs comparatively fewer people but contributes highest to GDP

This mismatch is known as **jobless growth**, especially in services.

## Structural Transformation of Indian Economy

## Shift in Sectoral Contribution
Over time, India has witnessed:
- Decline in agriculture’s share in GDP
- Rise of manufacturing and services
- Rapid growth of IT and financial services

However, the shift from agriculture to industry has been **slow compared to developed countries**.

## Role of Agriculture in Indian Economy

- Backbone of rural economy
- Major source of livelihood
- Supplies raw material to industries
- Contributes to food security
- Important for priority sector lending

Despite declining GDP share, agriculture remains **socially and economically critical**.
