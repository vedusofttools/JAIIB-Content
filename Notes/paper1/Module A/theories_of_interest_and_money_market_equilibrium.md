# Theories of Interest Rate & Money Market Equilibrium

============================================================

## 1. Introduction – Meaning of Interest Rate

Interest is the price paid for the use of money.

It represents:

- Reward for saving
- Cost of borrowing
- Compensation for liquidity sacrifice

The determination of interest rate has been explained by two major theories:

1. Classical Theory of Rate of Interest
2. Keynes’ Liquidity Preference Theory

============================================================

# PART I – CLASSICAL THEORY OF RATE OF INTEREST

============================================================

## 2. Classical Theory – Overview 

![graph](classical_saving_investment.png)

The Classical Theory states:

Interest rate is determined by demand and supply of capital.

It is a **real theory**, meaning it ignores money and focuses on real factors like saving and investment.

============================================================

## 3. Assumptions of Classical Theory

- Full employment of resources
- Perfect competition
- Flexible wages and prices
- Saving depends on interest rate
- Investment depends on interest rate

============================================================

## 4. Saving and Investment

Saving (S):

- Supply of capital
- Positively related to interest rate
- Higher interest → More saving

Investment (I):

- Demand for capital
- Negatively related to interest rate
- Higher interest → Less investment

============================================================

## 5. Determination of Interest Rate (Classical)

Equilibrium occurs when:

Saving = Investment

At equilibrium:

- Demand for capital equals supply of capital
- Interest rate is determined

If:

Saving > Investment → Interest rate falls  
Investment > Saving → Interest rate rises

============================================================

## 6. Criticism of Classical Theory

- Assumes full employment (unrealistic)
- Ignores role of money
- Saving may not be highly interest-sensitive
- Investment depends on expectations, not just interest

============================================================

# PART II – KEYNES’ LIQUIDITY PREFERENCE THEORY

============================================================

## 7. Overview

Keynes rejected the classical theory.

He argued:

Interest is determined in the money market,
not in the capital market.

Interest is the reward for parting with liquidity.

============================================================

## 8. Liquidity Preference

Liquidity preference means:

Desire to hold money instead of bonds.

People demand money for three motives:

1. Transaction motive
2. Precautionary motive
3. Speculative motive

============================================================

## 9. Money Demand Components
![graph](money_market_equilibrium.png)
Transaction demand:

- Depends on income
- Increases when income increases

Precautionary demand:

- For emergencies
- Also depends on income

Speculative demand:

- Depends on interest rate
- Inversely related to interest rate

============================================================

## 10. Money Demand Function

Total money demand:

M_d = L₁(Y) + L₂(r)

Where:

L₁(Y) → Income-dependent demand  
L₂(r) → Interest-dependent demand

============================================================

## 11. Determination of Interest Rate (Keynes)

Money supply is fixed by central bank.

Interest rate is determined where:

Money Demand = Money Supply

If money demand increases:

Interest rate rises.

If money supply increases:

Interest rate falls.

============================================================

## 12. Liquidity Trap

At very low interest rates:

- People expect rates to rise
- They prefer holding money
- Speculative demand becomes infinite

LM curve becomes horizontal.

Monetary policy becomes ineffective.

============================================================

# PART III – MONEY DEMAND CURVE

============================================================

## 13. Shape of Money Demand Curve

Money demand curve slopes downward
with respect to interest rate.

Reason:

At high interest rate:

People hold bonds.

At low interest rate:

People hold money.

============================================================

## 14. Shifts in Money Demand Curve

Money demand shifts right when:

- Income increases
- Uncertainty increases
- Precautionary demand rises

Money demand shifts left when:

- Income decreases
- Financial innovation reduces need for cash

============================================================

# PART IV – EQUILIBRIUM IN MONEY MARKET

============================================================

## 15. Money Market Equilibrium

Equilibrium condition:

Money Supply (M_s) = Money Demand (M_d)

At equilibrium:

Interest rate stabilizes.

If M_s > M_d:

Interest rate falls.

If M_d > M_s:

Interest rate rises.

============================================================

# PART V – EFFECT OF INCREASE IN MONEY SUPPLY

============================================================

## 16. Expansionary Monetary Policy

![graph](increase_money_supply.png)

When central bank increases money supply:

- Excess supply of money occurs
- People buy bonds
- Bond prices rise
- Interest rate falls

Lower interest rate:

- Encourages investment
- Increases income

============================================================

# PART VI – SHIFTS IN LIQUIDITY PREFERENCE CURVE

============================================================

## 17. Causes of Shift

Liquidity preference shifts right when:

- Income rises
- Uncertainty increases
- Fear of recession
- Financial instability

It shifts left when:

- Income falls
- Confidence improves

============================================================

## 18. Effect on Interest Rate

Rightward shift:

- Higher money demand
- Interest rate rises

Leftward shift:

- Lower money demand
- Interest rate falls

============================================================

# PART VII – COMPARISON: CLASSICAL vs KEYNES

============================================================

Classical Theory:

- Real theory
- Based on saving and investment
- Full employment assumption
- Ignores money

Keynes Theory:

- Monetary theory
- Based on liquidity preference
- Considers unemployment
- Emphasizes money supply

============================================================

# CONCLUSION

Interest rate can be viewed from:

1. Real perspective (Classical theory)
2. Monetary perspective (Keynes theory)

Modern macroeconomics integrates both views
through IS–LM framework.
