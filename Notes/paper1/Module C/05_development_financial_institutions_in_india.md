# Development Financial Institutions (DFIs) in India

## Meaning of Development Financial Institutions
Development Financial Institutions (DFIs) are **specialised financial institutions** established to provide:
- Long-term finance
- Project finance
- Development-oriented credit

## Need for DFIs in India

After Independence, India faced:
- Lack of long-term capital
- Weak industrial base
- Underdeveloped capital markets
- High risk in industrial projects

Commercial banks were focused on **short-term lending**, creating the need for DFIs.

## Gaps in the Post-Independence Financial System
- Absence of long-term industrial finance
- Limited access to capital markets
- High capital requirement for infrastructure
- Need for planned economic development

DFIs were created to bridge these gaps.
