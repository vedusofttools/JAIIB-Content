MODULE A – GENERAL BANKING OPERATIONS  
JAIIB – Detailed Notes (Legal + Operational + Risk-Oriented)

---

## 1. Introduction

Clearing, collection, and cash handling are core operational functions of a bank.  
Errors in these areas can result in:

- Financial loss
- Fraud
- Legal liability
- Regulatory penalties

This block covers:

- Cheque Truncation System (CTS)
- RBI Guidelines on Collection of Instruments
- Cash handling and custody
- Security arrangements at branches and ATMs

Understanding both operational procedure and legal responsibility is essential for JAIIB.

## 2. Concept of Clearing

Clearing refers to the process by which banks exchange instruments (like cheques) and settle the net amount payable between them.

Instead of each bank collecting cheques individually from every other bank, clearing houses facilitate settlement.

In India, clearing operations are supervised by:

- Reserve Bank of India (RBI)
- National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI)

Settlement is usually done on a net basis.

Example:

If Bank A has cheques worth ₹10 lakh drawn on Bank B, and Bank B has cheques worth ₹7 lakh drawn on Bank A, only ₹3 lakh is settled between them.

## 3. Cheque Truncation System (CTS)

### 3.1 Meaning of Truncation

Truncation means stopping the physical movement of cheque.

Under CTS:

- Physical cheque does not travel to drawee branch.
- Instead, a scanned image of cheque is transmitted electronically.

This system is governed by:

- Negotiable Instruments Act (as amended)
- RBI guidelines on CTS

---

### 3.2 Objectives of CTS

- Faster clearing
- Reduced transit time
- Lower risk of loss in transit
- Improved fraud detection

---

### 3.3 Operational Process in CTS

1. Customer deposits cheque in presenting bank.
2. Bank scans cheque and captures image.
3. Image and data transmitted electronically to clearing house.
4. Drawee bank verifies image.
5. Settlement done electronically.

Physical cheque remains with presenting bank.

---

### 3.4 Legal Recognition

Amendments to the Negotiable Instruments Act recognize:

- Electronic image of cheque
- Truncated cheque
- Electronic cheque

Thus, electronic image is legally valid for payment decision.

## 4. RBI Guidelines on Collection of Instruments

Banks must have board-approved policy on cheque collection.

Key Guidelines:

- Collection within specified time frame.
- Compensation for delay.
- Transparent disclosure of charges.
- Clear policy for outstation cheques.

If delay is attributable to bank, interest must be paid to customer.

Example:

If cheque collection delayed beyond policy time without valid reason, customer is entitled to compensation.

---

## 5. Collection of Local vs Outstation Cheques

Local Cheques:

- Cleared within local clearing house.
- Faster processing under CTS.

Outstation Cheques:

- May require sending to different city.
- Time frame governed by bank’s policy.

Banks must disclose maximum collection period.

---

## 6. Handling of Returned (Dishonoured) Cheques

If cheque is dishonoured:

- Return memo issued stating reason.
- Charges may be levied as per bank policy.

Common reasons:

- Insufficient funds
- Signature mismatch
- Account closed
- Stop payment instruction

Repeated dishonour may lead to account review.

## 7. Cash Handling – Importance

Cash handling involves:

- Acceptance of cash deposits
- Cash withdrawals
- Vault management
- ATM cash replenishment

Cash operations carry high operational risk.

---

## 8. Cash Custody at Branches

Branches must maintain:

- Strong room with dual control
- CCTV surveillance
- Alarm systems
- Cash retention limits
- Daily balancing procedures

Cash in vault must be under joint custody of authorized officers.

Cash balance must be verified daily.

---

## 9. Insurance and Security of Cash

Cash in branch and transit must be insured.

During transit:

- Armed guards required.
- Secure vehicles used.
- Route planning confidential.

Loss during transit may result in liability depending on circumstances.

---

## 10. ATM Cash Operations

ATM operations involve:

- Cash loading
- Reconciliation
- Monitoring failed transactions

Banks must:

- Ensure CCTV coverage.
- Maintain audit trail.
- Handle ATM disputes promptly.

In case of failed ATM withdrawal where amount debited but cash not dispensed:

- Customer complaint must be resolved within prescribed timeline.
- Compensation may be payable for delay.

---

## 11. Security Arrangements at Branches

Branches must implement:

- Access control systems.
- Fire safety systems.
- CCTV monitoring.
- Intrusion alarms.
- Emergency response procedures.

Operational risk increases in rural or high-crime areas.

## 12. Fraud Risks in Clearing and Cash

Common frauds include:

- Cheque alteration.
- Forged signatures.
- Duplicate cheque presentment.
- ATM skimming.
- Cash misappropriation.

Banks must train staff to detect:

- Altered instruments.
- Suspicious cash deposits.

---

## 13. Internal Controls in Clearing

Internal control measures include:

- Maker-checker system.
- Image verification.
- Signature verification.
- Audit trail maintenance.
- Exception reporting.

Deviation from internal controls may make bank liable.

---

## 14. Legal Liability in Clearing Operations

In CTS environment:

- Paying bank must verify signature and detect apparent alteration.
- Collecting bank must act without negligence.

If negligence is proved, statutory protection may not apply.

Clearing errors can result in civil liability.

---

## 15. Case-Based Understanding

Case 1:

Cheque altered but alteration not apparent.  
If paying bank acted in good faith, protection may apply.

Case 2:

Cheque lost during transit before truncation.  
Liability depends on custody stage.

Case 3:

ATM failed transaction not reversed within regulatory timeline.  
Compensation payable to customer.
