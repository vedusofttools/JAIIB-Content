JAIIB – Detailed Concept Notes (Beginner Friendly, Conceptual & Exam-Oriented)

---

## 1. Introduction

Deposit products are the core liability products of a bank. They form the primary source of funds for lending and investment. Understanding deposit products is essential not only for JAIIB but also for practical banking operations.

In this block, we will study:

- Types of deposit accounts
- Features of each deposit
- Regulatory aspects
- Operational characteristics
- Practical examples

Deposit accounts create a debtor–creditor relationship unless money is earmarked for a specific purpose.

## 2. Classification of Deposits

Deposits are broadly classified into:

1. Demand Deposits
2. Time Deposits

Demand deposits are repayable on demand.  
Time deposits are repayable after a specified period.

---

## 3. Demand Deposits

### 3.1 Savings Bank Account

A savings account is meant primarily for individuals to encourage savings.

Key features:

- Interest is payable.
- Limited withdrawals as per bank policy.
- Suitable for salaried persons, pensioners, students.
- Minimum balance requirements may apply.

Interest Calculation:

As per RBI guidelines, interest on savings bank account is calculated on daily closing balance and credited periodically.

Example:

If a customer maintains ₹1,00,000 for 30 days at 3% annual interest:

Interest = 1,00,000 × 3% × (30/365)

This method ensures fairness in interest calculation.

Operational Points:

- KYC compliance mandatory.
- Nomination facility available.
- Joint accounts permitted.
- Can issue ATM/debit card.

Savings account is a demand deposit because money can be withdrawn at any time.

### 3.2 Current Account

Current accounts are primarily meant for business entities.

Key features:

- No interest is generally paid.
- Unlimited transactions allowed.
- Overdraft facility may be provided.
- Suitable for firms, companies, traders.

Important:

As per RBI norms, current accounts cannot be opened freely when a borrower has exposure with another bank beyond specified thresholds. Banks must comply with RBI’s discipline on current accounts for borrowers.

Example:

A company maintaining frequent inward and outward payments will prefer current account due to transaction flexibility.

Current account also falls under demand deposits.

## 4. Time Deposits

Time deposits are repayable after a fixed period.

They include:

- Fixed Deposit (FD)
- Recurring Deposit (RD)
- Term Deposit schemes

---

### 4.1 Fixed Deposit (Term Deposit)

A fixed deposit is a lump sum deposited for a fixed tenure.

Features:

- Higher interest compared to savings account.
- Premature withdrawal allowed with penalty.
- Can be cumulative or non-cumulative.
- TDS applicable as per Income Tax rules.

Example:

If ₹2,00,000 is deposited for 1 year at 7%:

Interest = 2,00,000 × 7%  
= ₹14,000 (simple case)

In cumulative deposits, interest may be compounded quarterly.

Premature Withdrawal:

Banks usually charge penalty of 0.5% to 1% on interest rate for premature withdrawal.

Loan Against FD:

Banks may grant loan against fixed deposit up to 90% of deposit amount.

---

### 4.2 Recurring Deposit (RD)

Recurring Deposit allows customer to deposit fixed amount monthly for a fixed period.

Features:

- Encourages disciplined savings.
- Interest similar to term deposit.
- Premature closure allowed with conditions.

Example:

If customer deposits ₹5,000 per month for 24 months at 6%:

Interest calculated depending on compounding rules.

Suitable for salaried persons planning future expenses.

---

## 5. Special Deposit Schemes

Banks offer special schemes based on regulatory or customer segment requirements.

### 5.1 Senior Citizen Deposits

- Higher interest rate than regular FD.
- Age eligibility: 60 years and above.
- Sometimes additional 0.25%–0.50% interest.

### 5.2 Tax Saving Deposits

- Lock-in period of 5 years.
- Eligible for deduction under Income Tax provisions.
- Premature withdrawal not permitted.

### 5.3 Flexi Deposits

- Combination of savings and FD.
- Excess funds automatically converted into term deposit.
- Improves interest earnings.

## 6. Bulk Deposits

Bulk deposits are large-value deposits accepted from institutions or corporates.

Features:

- Negotiable interest rate.
- Higher volatility.
- May affect bank liquidity risk.

RBI monitors bulk deposits as part of liquidity management and risk supervision.

---

## 7. Interest on Deposits – Regulatory Aspects

RBI deregulated savings bank interest rates, allowing banks to decide rates.

Interest on term deposits depends on:

- Tenure
- Amount
- Market conditions
- ALM (Asset Liability Management) considerations

Important Operational Rules:

- Interest must be paid at contracted rate.
- Premature withdrawal penalty must be disclosed.
- Interest calculation must follow transparent policy.

## 8. Operational Features Common to Deposit Products

1. KYC compliance mandatory before opening account.
2. Nomination facility must be offered.
3. Passbook or statement must be provided.
4. Banks must ensure AML compliance.
5. Dormant account monitoring required.
6. TDS deduction where applicable.

---

## 9. Risk Considerations in Deposit Products

Banks must manage:

- Liquidity risk
- Interest rate risk
- Concentration risk (bulk deposits)
- Operational risk

Example:

If too many deposits are short-term but loans are long-term, bank faces maturity mismatch.

This is managed through Asset Liability Management (ALM).

---

## 10. Deposit Insurance

Deposits in banks are insured by Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) up to the prescribed limit per depositor per bank.

This enhances public confidence in banking system.

---

## 11. Practical Banking Examples

Example 1:

A salaried employee wants emergency liquidity → chooses savings account.

Example 2:

A business entity with daily transactions → chooses current account.

Example 3:

A retired person with surplus funds → chooses senior citizen FD.

Example 4:

A parent planning for child’s education → chooses recurring deposit.
