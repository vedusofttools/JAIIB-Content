Different Modes of Charging Securities

MODULE B – FUNCTIONS OF BANKS  
JAIIB – Detailed Notes (Legal + Conceptual + Case-Oriented)

---

## 1. Introduction

When a bank takes security for a loan, it must create a legal charge over the asset.

“Charge” means a legal right created in favour of the bank over borrower’s property as security for repayment.

Without proper charge creation:

- Security becomes ineffective.
- Recovery becomes difficult.
- Bank may lose priority over other creditors.

This block covers:

- Essentials of a valid contract
- Contract of Agency
- Contract of Bailment
- Types of charges
- Registration of charges

# PART I – ESSENTIALS OF A VALID CONTRACT

---

## 2. Meaning of Contract

Under the Indian Contract Act, 1872:

A contract is an agreement enforceable by law.

Loan agreements and security documents must satisfy legal contract requirements.

---

## 3. Essentials of a Valid Contract

1. Offer and acceptance
2. Lawful consideration
3. Competent parties
4. Free consent
5. Lawful object
6. Not expressly declared void

If any essential is missing, contract may become void or voidable.

Example:

Loan agreement signed under coercion → voidable.

---

## 4. Capacity to Contract

A person is competent to contract if:

- Major (18 years)
- Of sound mind
- Not disqualified by law

Loan to minor is void.

Security obtained from minor is unenforceable.

This is a common JAIIB trap question.

# PART II – CONTRACT OF AGENCY

---

## 5. Meaning of Agency

Under Contract Act:

An agent is a person employed to do any act for another or to represent another in dealings with third persons.

In banking:

- Collection of cheques → Bank acts as agent.
- Recovery agent → Acts on behalf of bank.

Principal is responsible for acts of agent within authority.

---

## 6. Termination of Agency

Agency terminates by:

- Revocation
- Completion of business
- Death of principal
- Insanity
- Insolvency

After termination, agent cannot bind principal.

---

# PART III – CONTRACT OF BAILMENT

---

## 7. Meaning of Bailment

Bailment means delivery of goods for some purpose with condition of return after purpose is fulfilled.

In banking:

- Pledge of goods
- Safe custody services

Bailor = Customer  
Bailee = Bank

Bank must take reasonable care of goods.

---

# PART IV – TYPES OF CHARGES

---

## 8. Pledge

Pledge is bailment of goods as security for payment of debt.

Possession of goods is transferred to bank.

Example:

Gold loan.

Rights of bank:

- Retain goods
- Sell after notice if borrower defaults

Pledge provides strong control due to possession.

---

## 9. Hypothecation

Hypothecation is charge over movable property without transfer of possession.

Possession remains with borrower.

Example:

Vehicle loan
Stock hypothecation

Risk:

Borrower may dispose of goods without bank’s knowledge.

Bank relies on periodic monitoring.

---

## 10. Mortgage

Mortgage is transfer of interest in immovable property as security.

Governed by Transfer of Property Act.

Types of mortgage include:

- Simple mortgage
- Equitable mortgage
- Registered mortgage

In banking, equitable mortgage (deposit of title deeds) is common.

Mortgage gives bank right to sell property through legal process.

---

## 11. Assignment

Assignment means transfer of rights from one person to another.

Common in:

- Life insurance policy
- Book debts
- Receivables

Assignment may be:

- Legal assignment
- Equitable assignment

Notice to debtor is important in case of receivables.

---

## 12. Lien

Lien is right to retain possession of goods until debt is paid.

Banks have general lien under law.

Lien does not give automatic right to sell unless agreed.

Lien differs from pledge because pledge gives right of sale.

---

# PART V – REGISTRATION OF CHARGES

---

## 13. Importance of Registration

Registration gives:

- Public notice of charge
- Priority over other creditors
- Legal enforceability

In case of companies:

Charges must be registered with Registrar of Companies within prescribed time.

Failure to register may:

- Make charge void against liquidator
- Affect bank’s recovery rights

---

## 14. CERSAI Registration

Charges on movable and immovable property must be registered with CERSAI.

Purpose:

- Prevent multiple financing
- Create centralized record

Banks must check CERSAI before sanction.

---

## 15. Priority of Charges

Priority generally depends on:

- Date of creation
- Date of registration

First registered charge usually gets priority.

Delay in registration may cause loss of priority.

---

## 16. Difference Between Pledge and Hypothecation

Pledge:
- Possession with bank
- Stronger control
- Right of sale available

Hypothecation:
- Possession with borrower
- Higher monitoring required
- Risk of misuse

---

## 17. Case-Based Understanding

Case 1:

Bank sanctions vehicle loan but fails to record hypothecation in RC.  
Security becomes weak.

Case 2:

Company creates charge but not registered with ROC.  
In liquidation, bank may lose priority.

Case 3:

Gold pledged but bank sells without notice.  
Sale may be challenged.

Case 4:

Book debts assigned but debtor not informed.  
Recovery complications may arise.

---

## 18. Important JAIIB Points

- Minor cannot create valid security.
- Pledge requires transfer of possession.
- Hypothecation does not transfer possession.
- Mortgage relates to immovable property.
- Charges must be registered with ROC (for companies).
- CERSAI registration prevents multiple financing.
- Registration ensures priority.

---

## 19. Conceptual Clarity

Creating charge properly is as important as sanctioning the loan.

Security without legal charge is ineffective.

Bank must ensure:

- Valid contract
- Proper documentation
- Correct mode of charge
- Timely registration

Strong legal foundation ensures enforceability during recovery.
