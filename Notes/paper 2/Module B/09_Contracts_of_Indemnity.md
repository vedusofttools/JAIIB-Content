JAIIB – Detailed Notes (Legal + Conceptual + Banking Application)

---

## 1. Introduction

In banking operations, indemnity plays a crucial role in protecting the bank against potential losses.

Banks frequently obtain indemnity in situations where:

- Risk exists due to missing documents
- Duplicate instruments are issued
- Legal heir claims are processed
- Guarantees are issued
- Bills are discounted

Understanding indemnity is essential because it defines liability and risk allocation between parties.

# PART I – MEANING AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK

---

## 2. Definition of Contract of Indemnity

Under Section 124 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872:

A contract of indemnity is a contract by which one party promises to save the other from loss caused by the conduct of the promisor himself or by the conduct of any other person.

Parties involved:

- Indemnifier (person who promises to compensate)
- Indemnified (person who is protected against loss)

---

## 3. Essential Elements of Indemnity

1. There must be a promise to compensate.
2. Loss must arise from conduct of promisor or third party.
3. Loss must be legally enforceable.
4. Contract must satisfy essentials of valid contract.

Without lawful consideration and free consent, indemnity is invalid.

# PART II – RIGHTS OF INDEMNITY HOLDER

---

## 4. Rights of Indemnified (Section 125)

The indemnity holder is entitled to recover:

1. All damages which he may be compelled to pay.
2. All costs incurred in defending suit (if reasonable).
3. All sums paid under compromise (if prudent).

The indemnity holder must act in good faith.

---

## 5. When Can Indemnified Claim?

Indemnified can claim:

- After actual loss occurs.
- In some judicial interpretations, even when liability becomes certain.

In banking, indemnity is invoked when actual financial loss occurs.

# PART III – DISTINCTIVE FEATURES OF INDEMNITY

## 6. Indemnity vs Guarantee

Indemnity:
- Two parties.
- Primary liability of indemnifier.
- Loss compensated after occurrence.

Guarantee:
- Three parties.
- Surety’s liability secondary.
- Surety pays if principal debtor defaults.

This distinction is important in banking cases.

---

## 7. Implied Indemnity

Indemnity may be express or implied.

Example:

If bank acts on customer’s request and suffers loss, customer may be impliedly liable to indemnify bank.

Implied indemnity often arises in agency relationships.

---

# PART IV – ENFORCEABILITY OF INDEMNITY

---

## 8. Enforceability Conditions

For enforceability:

- Contract must be lawful.
- Loss must be real and not speculative.
- Indemnified must not act negligently.

If indemnified acts recklessly, indemnifier may deny liability.

---

## 9. Scope of Indemnity in Banking

Banks take indemnity in various situations:

- Issue of duplicate demand draft
- Payment of lost cheque
- Settlement without original deposit receipt
- Transmission of shares
- Locker break-open cases

Indemnity protects bank from future claims.

# PART V – APPLICATION IN BANKING

---

## 10. Indemnity in Case of Lost Instruments

If customer loses:

- Demand Draft
- Fixed Deposit Receipt
- Cheque

Bank may issue duplicate after obtaining indemnity bond.

If later original instrument is presented, bank can recover from indemnifier.

---

## 11. Indemnity in Case of Deceased Depositor

If legal heirs claim deposit without succession certificate, bank may release funds against indemnity bond.

This protects bank against future competing claims.

---

## 12. Indemnity in Bills Discounting

If bank discounts bill and drawer disputes liability, indemnity clauses protect bank’s position.

---

## 13. Indemnity in Guarantee Issuance

When bank issues guarantee, borrower signs counter-indemnity in favour of bank.

If bank pays under guarantee, borrower must reimburse bank.

Counter-indemnity makes borrower primarily liable to bank.

---

# PART VI – PRACTICAL RISK CONSIDERATIONS

---

## 14. Precautions While Taking Indemnity

Bank must ensure:

- Proper execution of indemnity bond
- Adequate stamp duty
- Identity of indemnifier verified
- Financial capacity of indemnifier assessed

Weak indemnity defeats purpose.

---

## 15. Limitation Period

Claim under indemnity must be within limitation period.

Limitation usually begins from date of loss.

Revival letters may extend limitation.

---

# PART VII – CASE-BASED UNDERSTANDING

---

## 16. Case 1

Customer loses fixed deposit receipt and requests duplicate.

Bank issues duplicate without indemnity.

Later original receipt presented fraudulently.

Bank may bear loss due to lack of indemnity.

---

## 17. Case 2

Bank releases deceased depositor’s balance without succession certificate but takes indemnity from one heir.

Later another heir files claim.

Bank can recover from indemnifier.

---

## 18. Case 3

Bank pays under bank guarantee invoked by beneficiary.

Borrower refuses reimbursement.

Bank can enforce counter-indemnity.

# PART VIII – IMPORTANT JAIIB POINTS

---

## 19. Key Takeaways

- Defined under Section 124 of Contract Act.
- Two parties involved.
- Liability of indemnifier is primary.
- Indemnity protects against loss caused by third party.
- Indemnity bond commonly used in banking.
- Counter-indemnity is standard in bank guarantees.
- Proper stamping and execution necessary.

---

## 20. Conceptual Clarity

Indemnity is a protective legal mechanism.

In banking:

It shifts risk from bank to customer.

Whenever bank acts in special circumstances involving risk, indemnity ensures:

- Legal protection
- Financial security
- Risk mitigation

Strong understanding of indemnity helps distinguish it from guarantee, which is covered separately in the next block.
