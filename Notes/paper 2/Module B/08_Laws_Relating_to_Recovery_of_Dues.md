# PART VI – COMPARATIVE UNDERSTANDING

---

## 17. DRT vs SARFAESI vs IBC

DRT:

IBC:

- Focus on revival or liquidation

Each mechanism serves different purpose.

## 18. Case-Based Understanding

Case 1:

Secured loan becomes NPA.  
Bank may invoke SARFAESI.

Case 2:

Company unable to repay multiple lenders.  
IBC proceedings may be initiated.

Case 3:

Small borrower disputes minor amount.  
Lok Adalat suitable.

Case 4:

Limitation expired without acknowledgment.  
Legal recovery may be barred.

## 19. Important JAIIB Points

- DRT established under RDB Act, 1993.
- SARFAESI allows enforcement without court.
- Section 13(2) notice gives 60 days.
- IBC provides time-bound resolution.
- Moratorium prevents recovery during CIRP.

Proper documentation + timely action + legal compliance are essential for successful recovery.
