Non-Performing Assets (NPA) & Stressed Assets

MODULE B – FUNCTIONS OF BANKS  
JAIIB – Detailed Notes (Regulatory + Analytical + Practical Focus)

---

## 1. Introduction

Asset quality is the most important indicator of a bank’s financial health.

When borrowers fail to repay as per agreed terms, loan accounts may become:

- Irregular
- Stressed
- Non-Performing Assets (NPA)

NPA management is heavily regulated by RBI through prudential norms.

Understanding classification, provisioning, and resolution is extremely important for JAIIB.

# PART I – DEFINITION AND CONCEPT

---

## 2. Meaning of Non-Performing Asset (NPA)

A loan account becomes NPA when:

Interest and/or installment of principal remains overdue for more than 90 days.

For cash credit/overdraft:

Account becomes NPA if it remains “out of order” for more than 90 days.

---

## 3. Meaning of “Out of Order”

A cash credit/OD account is treated as out of order if:

- Outstanding balance exceeds sanctioned limit continuously, OR
- There are no credits continuously for 90 days, OR
- Credits are insufficient to cover interest debited

---

## 4. Income Recognition Norms

For Standard Assets:
Interest is recognized on accrual basis.

For NPA Accounts:
Interest must not be recognized on accrual basis.
It can be recognized only when actually received.

This prevents overstatement of income.

---

# PART II – ASSET CLASSIFICATION

---

## 5. Categories of Assets

Bank advances are classified into:

1. Standard Assets
2. Sub-standard Assets
3. Doubtful Assets
4. Loss Assets

---

## 6. Standard Asset

Loan performing regularly.

No default beyond permitted period.

No provisioning required except general provision.

---

## 7. Sub-Standard Asset

Account remains NPA for up to 12 months.

Higher provisioning required compared to standard assets.

---

## 8. Doubtful Asset

Account remains in sub-standard category for more than 12 months.

Provisioning increases based on:

- Period for which asset is doubtful
- Secured vs unsecured portion

---

## 9. Loss Asset

Asset identified as uncollectible by:

- Bank
- Auditor
- RBI inspection

Provisioning required at 100%.

Even if not written off, it is treated as loss asset.

---

# PART III – PROVISIONING NORMS

---

## 10. Meaning of Provisioning

Provisioning means:

Setting aside funds to cover potential losses.

It reduces bank’s profit but strengthens balance sheet.

Provisioning depends on asset classification.

---

## 11. Provisioning on Standard Assets

Banks must maintain general provision even on performing assets.

This acts as buffer against future losses.

---

## 12. Provisioning on NPA Accounts

Provisioning increases progressively:

- Sub-standard → Moderate provision
- Doubtful → Higher provision
- Loss asset → Full provision

Unsecured portion requires higher provisioning.

---

# PART IV – GROSS & NET NPA

---

## 13. Gross Advances

Total loans and advances given by bank before adjusting provisions.

---

## 14. Gross NPA

Total amount of loans classified as NPA.

Gross NPA Ratio = Gross NPA / Gross Advances

Indicates overall asset quality.

---

## 15. Net Advances

Gross Advances minus Provisions.

---

## 16. Net NPA

Net NPA = Gross NPA minus Provisions.

Net NPA Ratio = Net NPA / Net Advances

Indicates real exposure after provisioning.

Lower ratio indicates better asset quality.

---

# PART V – WRITE-OFF OF NPAs

---

## 17. Meaning of Write-Off

Write-off means removing bad loan from books.

Types:

- Technical Write-Off (remains for recovery tracking)
- Prudential Write-Off

Write-off does not mean waiver of loan.

Recovery efforts continue.

---

# PART VI – STRESSED ASSETS & RESOLUTION

---

## 18. Stressed Assets

Stressed assets include:

- SMA accounts (Special Mention Accounts)
- NPAs
- Restructured accounts

SMA classification helps identify early stress.

---

## 19. Special Mention Accounts (SMA)

SMA categories identify incipient stress before NPA stage.

- SMA-0 → Delay up to 30 days
- SMA-1 → 31–60 days
- SMA-2 → 61–90 days

Helps in early corrective action.

---

## 20. Framework for Resolution of Stressed Assets

Banks must have:

- Early identification system
- Corrective action plan
- Restructuring mechanism
- Recovery strategy

Restructuring must follow prudential norms.

Improper restructuring may result in asset downgrade.

---

## 21. Prudential Norms on Restructuring

Restructuring involves:

- Modification of repayment terms
- Extension of tenure
- Change in interest

If restructuring done due to borrower stress:

- Asset classification norms apply strictly.
- Provisioning requirements may increase.

---

# PART VII – NPA MANAGEMENT

---

## 22. Importance of Effective Mechanism

Effective NPA management requires:

- Granular data analysis
- Risk monitoring
- Sectoral review
- Legal action when necessary

Weak monitoring leads to higher slippages.

---

## 23. Case-Based Understanding

Case 1:

Term loan installment overdue for 95 days.  
Account becomes NPA.

Case 2:

Cash credit account shows credits but insufficient to cover interest for 90 days.  
Treated as out of order → NPA.

Case 3:

Account restructured but still irregular.  
May require downgrade.

Case 4:

Provision not made correctly.  
Bank’s financial statements become distorted.

---

## 24. Important JAIIB Points

- NPA defined as overdue beyond 90 days.
- Cash credit treated NPA if “out of order”.
- Interest on NPA not recognized on accrual basis.
- Asset classification: Standard → Sub-standard → Doubtful → Loss.
- Provisioning increases with deterioration.
- Gross NPA vs Net NPA distinction important.
- Write-off does not mean waiver.
- SMA classification helps early detection.

---

## 25. Conceptual Clarity

NPA management is central to banking stability.

Poor credit appraisal + weak monitoring → NPAs.  
NPAs reduce profitability and capital adequacy.

Strong adherence to:

- Income recognition norms
- Asset classification norms
- Provisioning norms

ensures transparency and financial discipline.
