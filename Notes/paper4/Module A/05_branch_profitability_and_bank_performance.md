# Branch Profitability & Bank Performance

============================================================

## 1. Banking System – An Introduction

A banking system consists of:

- Central Bank (RBI)
- Commercial Banks
- Regional Rural Banks
- Cooperative Banks
- Small Finance Banks
- Payment Banks

Banks operate with objective of:

Profitability + Financial stability.

============================================================

## 2. Meaning of Profit

Profit = Income – Expenses

In banking:

Income mainly from:
- Interest earned
- Fee income

Expenses mainly include:
- Interest paid on deposits
- Operating expenses
- Provisions

============================================================

## 3. Types of Profit

------------------------------------------------------------

Gross Profit:

Income before operating expenses.

------------------------------------------------------------

Operating Profit:

Gross Profit – Operating Expenses

------------------------------------------------------------

Net Profit:

Operating Profit – Provisions – Taxes

Net profit is final earnings.

============================================================

# 4. Profit vs Profitability

Profit:

Absolute figure.

Profitability:

Ability to generate profit
Relative to assets or capital.

Profitability ratios are more meaningful.

============================================================

# 5. Profitability in Banking Context

Banks evaluate performance using:

- Net Interest Income (NII)
- Net Interest Margin (NIM)
- Return on Assets (ROA)
- Return on Equity (ROE)

============================================================

## 6. Return on Assets (ROA)

ROA = Net Profit / Total Assets × 100

Indicates efficiency in using assets.

Higher ROA → Better performance.

In banking, even 1% ROA is considered good.

============================================================

## 7. Return on Equity (ROE)

ROE = Net Profit / Shareholders’ Equity × 100

Measures return to shareholders.

Higher ROE → Higher shareholder value.

============================================================

## 8. Branch Operating Efficiency

Branch efficiency depends on:

- Cost control
- CASA mobilisation
- Loan recovery
- Cross-selling
- Customer service quality

Efficiency = Income generation vs expenses incurred.

============================================================

# 9. Factors Affecting Profitability of Banks in India

- Interest rate changes
- NPA levels
- Competition
- Regulatory requirements
- Cost of funds
- Technology investment
- Economic conditions

============================================================

# 13. Continuous Improvement Factors

- Branch efficiency measures
- Factors affecting profitability in India

============================================================

Quick Recall:

Profit ≠ Profitability  
ROA measures asset efficiency  
ROE measures shareholder return  
High CASA improves profitability
